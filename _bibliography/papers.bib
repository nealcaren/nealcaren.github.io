	abstract = {On 1 January 2009, Oscar Grant was shot and killed in a subway station by Bay Area Rail Transit officers. This event was recorded by several passengers on their cellphones and later uploaded to the video-sharing website YouTube. The videos generated significant protests among online and offline communities, and were eventually used as evidence in the ensuing trial. This study employed a critical thematic analysis to examine audience responses to this act of citizen journalism on YouTube. Results indicated that although some viewers critiqued the video quality and the cameraperson’s passivity, several supportive comments praised the cameraperson’s presence of mind and courage. Furthermore, some viewers called for resistance and retaliation, while others advocated a more prudent response. We argue that these findings necessitate a reconceptualization of traditional notions of the guard-dog media and the public sphere to accommodate new media technologies.},

We argue that some of this disagreement owes to scholars studying different kinds of Internet activism. Therefore, we introduce a typology of Internet activism, which shows that markedly different findings are associated with different types of Internet activism and that some types of Internet activism have been studied far more frequently than others. As a consequence, we ask an empirical question: is this skew in the selection of cases, and hence apparent trends in findings, a reflection of the empirical frequency of different types of Internet activism? Troublingly, using unique data from random samples of websites discussing 20 different issue areas commonly associated with social movements, we find a mismatch between trends in research cases studied and empirical frequency.},

However, scholars have yet to measure the extent of contemporary fan activism, account for why fan discontent has been expressed through protest, or precisely specify the role of the Internet in this expansion. We argue that these questions can be addressed by drawing on a growing body of work by social movement scholars on “movement societies,” and more particularly on a nascent thread of this approach we develop that theorizes the appropriation of protest practices for causes outside the purview of traditional social movements. Theorizing that the Internet, as a new media, is positioned to accelerate the diffusion of protest practices, we develop and test hypotheses about the use of movement practices for fan activism and other nonpolitical claims online using data on claims made in quasi-random samples of online petitions, boycotts, and e-mailing or letter-writing campaigns. Results are supportive of our hypotheses, showing that diverse claims are being pursued online, including culturally-oriented and consumer-based claims that look very different from traditional social movement claims. Findings have implications for students of social movements, sociologists of culture, and Internet studies.},

The Toronto Community Mobilization Network, the network that coordinated the protests, urged participants to broadcast news using Twitter, YouTube, and Flickr. This particular use of social media is studied in the light of the history and theory of alternative journalism. Analyzing a set of 11,556 tweets, 222 videos, and 3,338 photos, the article assesses user participation in social media protest reporting, as well as the resulting protest accounts. The findings suggest that social media did not facilitate the crowd-sourcing of alternative reporting, except to some extent for Twitter. As with many previous alternative journalistic efforts, reporting was dominated by a relatively small number of users. In turn, the resulting account itself had a strong event-oriented focus, mirroring often-criticized mainstream protest reporting practices.},

This article develops some observable implications of the concept of connective action and tests them against the case of the 15M demonstration. Cases of self-organized connective action networks are expected to be different from traditional collective action cases with regard to the characteristics of the organizations involved, the prevalent mobilization channels and the characteristics of participants. Based on a comparative analysis of data gathered from participants and organizations in nine demonstrations held in Spain between 2010 and 2011, relevant and significant differences were found in the characteristics of the 15M staging organizations (recently created, without formal membership and mainly online presence), the main mobilization channels (personal contact and online social networks rather than co-members or broadcast media), and participants (younger, more educated and less politically involved). These findings help to understand the large turnout figures of this movement and have important implications for the mobilization potential of social networks, particularly as it can affect the political participation of the less-involved citizens.},

In this article, the authors argue that evaluating the relation between transforming communication technologies and collective action demands recognizing how such technologies infuse specific protest ecologies. This includes looking beyond informational functions to the role of social media as organizing mechanisms and recognizing that traces of these media may reflect larger organizational schemes. Three points become salient in the case of Twitter against this background: (a) Twitter streams represent crosscutting networking mechanisms in a protest ecology, (b) they embed and are embedded in various kinds of gatekeeping processes, and (c) they reflect changing dynamics in the ecology over time. The authors illustrate their argument with reference to two hashtags used in the protests around the 2009 United Nations Climate Summit in Copenhagen.},

	abstract = {As people spend increasing proportions of their daily lives using social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, they are being invited to support myriad political causes by sharing, liking, endorsing, or downloading. Chain reactions caused by these tiny acts of participation form a growing part of collective action today, from neighborhood campaigns to global political movements. Political Turbulence reveals that, in fact, most attempts at collective action online do not succeed, but some give rise to huge mobilizations—even revolutions.Drawing on large-scale data generated from the Internet and real-world events, this book shows how mobilizations that succeed are unpredictable, unstable, and often unsustainable. To better understand this unruly new force in the political world, the authors use experiments that test how social media influence citizens deciding whether or not to participate. They show how different personality types react to social influences and identify which types of people are willing to participate at an early stage in a mobilization when there are few supporters or signals of viability. The authors argue that pluralism is the model of democracy that is emerging in the social media age—not the ordered, organized vision of early pluralists, but a chaotic, turbulent form of politics.This book demonstrates how data science and experimentation with social data can provide a methodological toolkit for understanding, shaping, and perhaps even predicting the outcomes of this democratic turbulence.},

Participation was examined as manifest in mobilization, identity building and organizational transformation. Digital prefigurative participation is a tentative construct that attempts to capture the CMC aspect of engagement in the three processes. The participatory processes were probed in the contrasting circumstances of high- and low-risk protest events. This distinction has revealed some important differences in the structural factors that foster participation, primary among which has been organizational affiliation. Yet, it has remained largely unexplored in studies of internet use in protest politics. Findings from two case studies of environmental protests in Romania and the UK suggest that digital prefigurative participation may be extensive among unaffiliated participants at a low-risk event and the affiliated at a high-risk one.},

In this article, the authors present the ‘state-of-the-art’ literature on action repertoires of social movements in an internet age. The article builds a strong case in favour of the internet as it has given social movements new and improved opportunities to engage in social and political action. At the same time, a naïve internet-optimism is avoided, by pointing out several limitations. There is the ‘classical’ problem of digital divide. In some cases, the internet has made collective action still not easy enough, while in others it has made it perhaps too easy reducing the final political impact of a certain action. In addition, it seems that the new media are loosing their newness quickly, and more fundamentally are unable to create stable ties between activists that are necessary for sustained collective action. With the internet, social movements have not become a more powerful force in society. But, as political and economical power has gradually moved to the international level, the internet has enabled social movements to follow that transition and operate more globally.},

New communications technology, especially activists' widespread adoption of social media, calls into question whether these claims apply equally to online social media-based coalitions. Using the case of the Egyptian revolution in the Arab Spring, we conduct a series of social network analyses of the Twitter networks of activists. We find that social movement coalitions theory accurately predicts the conditions under which coalitions form and dissolve for online activists, as it does for on-the-ground activists. Among activists of diverse ideologies, we identify a pattern of solidarity in the early days of the revolutionary period, followed by a period of schism after a military crackdown on protestors.

It identifies time spent in the occupied areas, participation leadership, and forms of actions undertaken as three aspects of a protester's mode of participation that can indicate a protester's degree of involvement in the movement. Analysis of a protester onsite survey shows that the protesters were active in four types of digital media activities: online expression, online debates, online explanatory activities, and mobile communication. Digital media activities are generally positively related to degree of involvement, but the four types of activities are also related to the three aspects of mode of participation differently.

This trend can be spotted in the rise of large-scale, rapidly forming political participation aimed at a variety of targets, ranging from parties and candidates, to corporations, brands, and transnational organizations. The group-based “identity politics” of the “new social movements” that arose after the 1960s still exist, but the recent period has seen more diverse mobilizations in which individuals are mobilized around personal lifestyle values to engage with multiple causes such as economic justice (fair trade, inequality, and development policies), environmental protection, and worker and human rights.},

Such developments bring individuals' own narratives to the fore in the mobilization process, often requiring organizations to be more flexible in their definitions of issues. This personalization of political action presents organizations with a set of fundamental challenges involving potential trade-offs between flexibility and effectiveness. This paper analyses how different protest networks used digital media to engage individuals in mobilizations targeting the 2009 G20 London Summit during the global financial crisis. The authors examine how these different communication processes affected the political capacity of the respective organizations and networked coalitions. In particular, the authors explore whether the coalition offering looser affiliation options for individuals displays any notable loss of public engagement, policy focus (including mass media impact), or solidarity network coherence. This paper also examines whether the coalition offering more rigid collective action framing and fewer personalized social media affordances displays any evident gain in the same dimensions of mobilization capacity. In this case, the evidence suggests that the more personalized collective action process maintains high levels of engagement, agenda focus, and network strength.},

	abstract = {This article aims to bridge a gap between social movement studies and media and communication studies. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates the political opportunity structure approach and the logics of contentious action with the concept of mediation. The author argues that mediation opportunity structure is a fruitful concept to encompass a wide variety of ways in which media and communication are relevant to protest and social movements. It refers to mainstream media representations of protest and movements, to movements ‘becoming the media’ and counter-spinning, as well as to media and communication practices that constitute protest and resistance in their own right. The manifold articulations of mediation illustrate that media and communication are not merely relevant to the symbolic and discursive realms in which social movements operate, but that they are also instrumental and material to realizing their immediate goals. Activists are becoming more aware and conscious of the mediation opportunity structure, through their lay-knowledge of how the mainstream media and technologies operate, partially adapting to them or appropriating them. The nature and degree of mediation opportunities for activists and the structural constraints impeding the opportunities varies according to the type of protest logic that is being used.},

We find that digital media use stimulates multiple activisms. Through information and communication technologies (ICTs), activists can maintain multiple engagements and manage weak ties with diverse protest and movement communities. The data also suggest that these multiple engagements and overlapping activisms effectively provide linkages to and integration within social movement networks. Core activists who are closely linked to protest organizations rely more on ICTs to manage their multiple commitments. Even activists less closely tied to core protest organizations can link to more diverse communities through Internet use. These basic patterns systematically hold across nations, across issues, and across time.},

While authors have extolled the virtues of Facebook and Twitter as organisational and informational tools for a range of movements from the Arab Spring to Occupy, evidence remains patchy as to under what conditions social media is most effective at engaging and mobilising the wider public. Drawing on the work of Tarrow, this article considers the impact of cycle effects on the effectiveness of social media as a mobilising and organising tool for the 2010/11 U.K. student protests. Although preceding the broader ‘movement of the squares’ contention cycle, the protests made similar use of social media for generating mass participation. Yet, its mobilising power was dependent on a number of temporal factors, including amplification through mainstream media and the urgency of its initial campaign goal. Moreover, towards the end of the cycle, activists were found to be using social media – via ‘secret’ Facebook groups – in ways that reinforced emerging group hierarchies, arguably contradicting their initial commitment to open-access networks and participatory democracy.},

Organizational forms have been viewed to be in flux as networked communication becomes embedded in mobilization repertoires. In what follows, it is shown that the utilization of Facebook by networked heterarchical organizations is seen to grant them access to a hitherto untapped demographic for the purpose of mobilization. Concurrently, questions are raised pertaining to organizational form, particularly in relation to the role the Facebook audience plays in movement organizations. Communication on Facebook may catalyze deliberation, information sharing and mobilization. Moreover, evidence was found pointing to its use for the self-organization of protest participation. Yet, engagement between SMOs and their Facebook audience bore little on decision-making within the organizations. Although limited in scope, the emerging contribution of such communication may be by way of channelling items into decision-making agendas.},

This study uses social network analysis to explore students' Twitter use during the 2010 university occupations. It maps the interconnections between Twitter occupation accounts at the peak of the online protest network's activity and examines how this structure benefited the entire network. It identifies (a) how “closely” accounts were connected, (b) which were the best connected, and (c) which acted as brokers. Findings show that the protest groups used the Twitter network structure to establish horizontal, direct lines of communication to efficiently redistribute information. Although some accounts played a larger role in distributing information than others, occupation accounts could continue to receive information from the decentralized network even if well-connected accounts were removed.},

As the first book-length study to examine how girls, women, and some men negotiate rape culture through the use of digital platforms, including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and mobile apps, the authors explore four primary questions: What experiences of harassment, misogyny, and rape culture are being responded to? How are participants using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? Why are girls, women and some men choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in this way? And finally, what are the various experiences of using digital technologies to engage in activism? In order to capture these diverse experiences of doing digital feminist activism, the authors augment their analysis of this media (blog posts, tweets, and selfies) with in-depth interviews and close-observations of several online communities that operate globally. Ultimately, the book demonstrates the nuances within and between digital feminist activism and highlight that, although it may be technologically easy for many groups to engage in digital feminist activism, there remain emotional, mental, or practical barriers which create different experiences, and legitimate some feminist voices, perspectives, and experiences over others.},

Through a case study of \#WhyIStayed, which arose in response to a 2014 NFL domestic violence controversy, I frame hashtag feminism as an extension of the movement’s historically rooted discursive tactics. Hashtag feminism’s narrative form implies that the conditions for a successful online feminist protest parallel the elements of an effective dramatic performance.

The analysis reveals that the Facebook performances are multisensory, staged to appear personal, and tightly scripted.

	abstract = {The Internet is causing major changes in the field of political activism. One particularly significant case is the 15M movement, which emerged from a popular initiative organized in several Spanish cities in 2011. Based on the analysis of these protests as a case study, this paper has two aims: first, to examine the role of digital technology – websites and social networks – in the online organization of political activism; second, to analyse the relationships established between the conventional media on the one hand and activists on the other. The methodology combines the technique of in-depth interviews and qualitative analysis of reports, working papers and file data about 15M. The findings show an intensive use of digital technology by activists, both of their own social networks (for example, N-1) and commercial ones (Facebook or Twitter). These digital tools enabled them to disseminate their own information and optimize their internal organization. The indignados established an interplay between online activism and offline actions. Digital technology facilitated the organization of the mass gatherings in the streets. The possession of communicative and technical skills played an important part in organizing 15M. On the other hand, the relationship between journalists and activists was a difficult one. The indignados did not follow the established patterns of the journalists’ work routines. The latter had to resort to the demonstrators’ websites and social networks to obtain information. The activists recognize that the conventional media were crucial to the protests achieving a widespread impact in the news.},

Focusing on three international cases, including the anti-street harassment site Hollaback!, the hashtag \#BeenRapedNeverReported, and interviews with teenage Twitter activists, the paper asks: What experiences of harassment, misogyny and rape culture are girls and women responding to? How are girls and women using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? And, why are girls and women choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in such a way? Employing an approach that includes ethnographic methods such as semi-structured interviews, content analysis, discursive textual analysis, and affect theories, we detail a range of ways that women and girls are using social media platforms to speak about, and thus make visible, experiences of rape culture. We argue that this digital mediation enables new connections previously unavailable to girls and women, allowing them to redraw the boundaries between themselves and others.},

In particular, this piece focuses on the ways in which Reddit’s karma point system, aggregation of material across subreddits, ease of subreddit and user account creation, governance structure, and policies around offensive content serve to provide fertile ground for anti-feminist and misogynistic activism. The ways in which these events and communities reflect certain problematic aspects of geek masculinity are also considered. This research is informed by the results of a long-term participant-observation and ethnographic study into Reddit’s culture and community and is grounded in actor-network theory.},

The news media has a well-documented tendency to disparage adult activists by excluding their voices from coverage, attacking their political identities, and minimizing their collective action outcomes. However, the perceived illegitimacy of youth activists suggests they have no voices to be excluded, no political identities to be attacked, and no outcomes to minimize. This study analyzes coverage of the virginity pledge movement and gay-straight alliances in nationally circulated newspapers across two decades. Findings indicate youth activists' illegitimacy actually guaranteed youth a voice in the news media, but this came with unintended consequences. The news media used this perceived illegitimacy to undermine youth activists in three ways: (1) restricting youth voices to personal (apolitical) testimonies, (2) engaging in displaced disparagement by attacking adults and other legitimate targets, and (3) holding adults accountable for collective action outcomes.},

We conduct a unique empirical analysis of media coverage of protest issues, based upon a data set of 48 large-scale street demonstrations in nine countries. Time-series cross-sectional analysis is used to estimate the dynamic effects of demonstration features on media coverage of the protest issue. The findings show that violence can increase media attention in the short term and larger protest size sustains it over the longer term. The agenda-setting power of protest is structured in time.},

We review recent research on movements’ impacts on public opinion and everyday behavior; the media and popular culture; nonpolitical institutions such as science, medicine, and education; and politics. We focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements’ constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts. We conclude with an agenda for future research, seeking greater connection between the literatures on movements and the literatures on the institutions that matter to movements.

Many of these protests occurred in new destinations, places with little prior history of collective mobilisation by non-citizens. We focus on the U.S. South, a region noteworthy for the recent, unprecedented growth in its non-citizen population and its unexpected role in the 2006 protests. Drawing from a unique dataset of immigration-related news stories from ten newspapers across the South from 2005 to 2007, we examine variation in public immigration discourse during this ‘unsettled’ period of heightened political mobilisation and marked public anxiety around immigration. We supplement this analysis with a close examination of immigration news coverage in English and Spanish-language newspapers in South Carolina. Regional analysis reveals minimal shifts in public immigration discourse during this time period; however, the South Carolina case study reveals subtle yet noteworthy variation in the cultural categories used to label immigrants, the moral characterisations of immigrants, and the salience of the immigrant-native boundary. The English-language press increasingly portrayed immigrants from Mexico as cultural threats. After the marches, the Spanish-language press emphasised immigrants’ work ethic. These findings have implications for our understanding of social dynamics in new destinations and the cultural dimensions of political mobilisation.},

Protest event data from police archives (Brussels; 2003–2010) are combined with detailed measures of television news content (public and private broadcasting) to analyze media description (N = 564). The results show that the coverage of protest is primarily thematic. Episodic coverage is dominated by coverage about the details of the event; exemplars are rarely used. Protests that are disruptive, staged by organizations with low media standing, and covered by the commercial station are more event-oriented. Reports of large demonstrations and reports with follow-up items contain more episodic-exemplar coverage. Results are discussed in light of the conditionality of the protest paradigm.},

	abstract = {Social movement scholars have considered several political and cultural consequences of social movements, but have paid limited attention to whether and how social movements shape discourse. We develop a theory of discursive eruption, referring to the ability of radical movements to initially ignite media coverage but not control the content once other actors— particularly those that can take advantage of journalistic norms—enter the discourse. We hold that one long-term outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues. We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further, we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement. These findings highlight the importance of social movements in shaping discourse and indicate that social movement scholars should further consider discursive changes as a consequence of social movements.},

Fox News is credited with legitimizing the Tea Party’s grievances, allowing the movement to make rapid inroads into the Republican Party. We argue that such depictions of the Tea Party’s relationship to the Republican Party are at least partially the product of an oversimplified media narrative emphasizing the seamless integration of the two. We analyze 201,678 media documents from blog posts from Tea Party organizations, Fox News, MSNBC, and 785 newspapers. Our results show marked differences between how the Tea Party frames itself compared with other media sources frame the movement. MSNBC and Fox News discuss the Tea Party strategically, respectively, treating the movement as representing the worst and best aspects of the Republican Party. This is in stark contrast to how the activists frame the movement as conservative, but not strictly Republican, and often in conflict with the goals of the Republican Party.},

To measure how protest changes over time or varies across space, sociologists usually count the frequency of events, as either the dependent variable or a key independent variable. An alternative is to count the number of participants in protest. This article investigates demonstrations, strikes, and riots. Their size distributions manifest enormous variation. Most events are small, but a few large events contribute the majority of protesters. When events are aggregated by year or by city, the correlation between total participation and event frequency is low or modest. The choice of how to quantify protest is therefore vital; findings from one measure are unlikely to apply to another. The fact that the bulk of participation comes from large events has positive implications for the compilation of event catalogs. Rather than worrying about the underreporting of small events, concentrate on recording large ones accurately.},

The results show that the protest paradigm is more likely to emerge if the protest involved radical tactics, if the protest’s target responded to the media, and, in politically conservative newspapers, when the protest addressed political topics. Protest coverage is less negative when the protest addressed a political matter, and there is evidence that protest coverage has become less negative over time.},

	abstract = {Media attention is crucial for social movements in pursuing their goals. Opinion makers in the press, in particular, can be expected to influence how mass audiences perceive protests. Yet we still have a poor understanding of the factors that explain the level of legitimacy that media commentators award to different protest actions. To address this gap, this paper compares 45 opinion articles written by press commentators in main-interest Portuguese newspapers about two of the prominent anti-austerity demonstrations in the country: the Geração à Rasca demonstration on 12 March 2011, and the Que se Lixe a Troika demonstration on 15 September 2012. Content analysis of this corpus of articles suggests that there were important differences in the level of legitimacy that commentators awarded to each of the protests. An analysis of the way commentators framed each protest suggests the use of a similar set of frames related to the characteristics of the protest events (e.g. claims, strategy), but differential deployment of these frames across the cases. For example, the same frames were sometimes used to legitimize one protest event, and delegitimize the other, and hence could not explain the differences in commentators’ views. It was rather the different context of the protests (e.g. social, economic and political), and the way that media commentators framed that context, that explains the level of legitimacy awarded to the two protests. Because the QSLT demonstration of 15 September 2012 was a protest directed against a measure that commentators framed as unfair and unnecessary (raising the single social tax), they regarded the demonstration as being more legitimate. In turn, because the Geração à Rasca demonstration occurred in a context where austerity was framed as necessary and unavoidable, it was regarded as less legitimate.},

In addition, we test whether media coverage underestimates, reflects, or exaggerates “guesstimates” by organizers and police forces. Together, these analyses shed light on whether turnout coverage fits a logic of normalization or marginalization. We rely on a unique dataset of 428 demonstrations organized in Brussels (2003–2010). For these demonstrations, we have information on the turnout as reported in national television news, as counted by the police, and as expected by the organizers. We find that media present turnout most often as a fact, rarely as contentious (10 percent). Although few demonstrations pass the media gates, our study yields little to no evidence for a logic of turnout marginalization. Media coverage does not systematically underestimate demonstration size, nor does it blindly follow police counts. Rather, turnout coverage attests of a logic of normalization, following standard news-making practices. The more important the demonstration (size, lead item) and the larger the gap between police and organizer guesstimates, the more attention is paid to turnout in the news. Discussion centers on the generalizability and normative interpretation of the results.},

Contrary to common assumptions, the results show that the presence of negative framing is not necessarily bad publicity for social movements.

Police archive data for the city of Brussels is compared to newscast data of the biggest public and commercial station in Belgium (2003-2010). Results show that few demonstrations pass the television gates (11\%). Above all, protest size accounts for newsworthiness. Disruptive and symbolic actions also attract the media spotlight, confirming drama and visuals as critical television news values. Whereas symbolism matters for media presence, it does not hold for headline (prominence) or length of coverage (volume). New social movements are especially likely to stage symbolic actions. As a consequence, their presence on the screen is less a function of their numeric weight in the street. Distinctive selection mechanisms are at work on the commercial and public broadcaster, suggesting that media ownership matters for news selection.},

While SMOs may still play a vital role in offline protest that is facilitated online, I argue that SMOs do not necessarily offer strong returns on investment for forms of protest in which participation occurs online or in which entire movements are organized online. Specifically, I argue that several critical functions for SMOs in offline social movements are not as applicable online, rendering SMOs less necessary for online participation and/or organizing. However, that SMOs may no longer be prerequisites for online protest does not imply their extinction for several reasons. First, noninstrumental motives may drive SMO formation and maintenance. Second, other situations remain, such as facilitating offline protest using the Internet, in which SMOs are still likely to provide significant returns on investment. Third, SMOs may be important to healthy movement ecologies such that entire social movements that are devoid of SMOs may operate less optimally than movements in which at least some SMOs are active. I close by arguing for increased research on settings where SMOs are absent and on alternative returns on investments for SMOs in Internet activism.},

First, we elaborate a theoretical argument that builds from the political mediation theory of movement consequences and incorporates the social organization of newspaper practices. This media and political mediation model integrates political and media contexts and organizations' characteristics and actions. With this model, we hypothesize two main routes to coverage: one that includes changes in public policy and involves policy-engaged, well-resourced, and inclusive organizations and a second that combines social crises and protest organizations. Second, we appraise these arguments with the first analysis of the national coverage of all organizations in a social movement over its career: 84 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights and AIDS-related organizations in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Wall Street Journal from 1969 to 2010. These analyses go beyond previous research that provides either snapshots of many organizations at one point in time or overtime analyses of aggregated groups of organizations or individual organizations. The results of both historical and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses support our media and political mediation model.},

We illustrate this claim by discussing how a greater focus on audiences and message reception, as well as message context, could advance the study of social movements. Specifically, we discuss a range of topics as applied to movement research, including information overload, selective attention, perceptions of bias, the possibilities that entertainment-related communications open up, and priming, among other topics. We suggest the risks of not adapting to this changing information environment, and incorporating insights from political communication, affect both the study of contemporary (including digital) protest, as well as potentially historical protest.

This study investigates how activism against hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) utilized cultural artifacts to influence public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and research on media, the environment, and energy.},

Yet these case studies of highly influential organizations obscure the much larger population that have little or no impact. It is therefore unclear whether civil society organizations create cultural change by deploying mainstream discourses or if they become part of the mainstream because of their success. I present an evolutionary theory of how discursive fields settle after major historical ruptures that highlights framing, social networks, and emotional energy. To illustrate this theory, I use plagiarism detection software to compare 1,084 press releases about Muslims produced by 120 civil society organizations to 50,407 newspaper articles and television transcripts produced between 2001 and 2008. Although most organizations deployed pro-Muslim discourses after the September 11th attacks, I show that anti-Muslim fringe organizations dominated the mass media via displays of fear and anger. Institutional amplification of this emotional energy, I argue, created a gravitational pull or “fringe effect” that realigned inter-organizational networks and altered the contours of mainstream discourse itself.},

	abstract = {When social movement organizations receive extensive newspaper coverage, why is it sometimes substantive and sometimes not? By “substantive,” we mean coverage that reflects serious treatment of the movement's issues, demands, or policy claims. Scholars agree that the news media are key to movement organizations' influence, helping them alter public discourse and effect political change, but often find that protests are covered nonsubstantively. Employing insights from literatures on historical institutionalism, the social organization of the news, and the consequences of movements, we elaborate an “institutional mediation” model that identifies the interactive effects on coverage of news institutions' operating procedures, movement organizations' characteristics and action, and political contexts. Although movement actors suffer compound legitimacy deficits with journalists, the institutional mediation model identifies the openings news institutions provide, the movement organizational characteristics, the forms of collective action likely to induce substantive news treatment, and the political contexts that will amplify or dampen these effects. We derive four interactive hypotheses from this model, addressing the effects of organizational identities, collective action, and political contexts on news outcomes. We appraise the hypotheses with comparative and qualitative comparative analyses of more than 1000 individually coded articles discussing the five most-covered organizations of the 1960s U.S. civil rights movement across four national newspapers. We find support for each hypothesis and discuss the implications for other movement organizations and the current media context.},

We show that larger newspapers, those that covered the Iraq War more extensively, and those in areas supporting the Democratic Party devoted more attention to the vigils.

	abstract = {We argue that social scientists need to adopt a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between Internet Communication Technologies (ICTs) and collective identity. Here, we identify four factors that interact and make collective identity “thick” or “thin”— an organization's structure of communication, the breadth of its mobilization efforts, its goals (which may or may not include collective identity), and supporters' interest in cultivating a political community. Drawing on interviews with and participant observation data on supporters in MoveOn.org and the Florida Tea Party Movement (FTPM), we find that MoveOn, which focuses on curating donors, cultivates a thin collective identity and the FTPM, which initially focused on mobilizing citizens across political lines, nurtures a thick collective identity. In our analysis, we illustrate how the four factors interact and outline the consequences of collective identity over time. We conclude the paper with a call for additional research on collective identity.},

	abstract = {Donald Trump’s 2016 electoral victory was a shock for feminist scholars, yet it was no surprise to his legion of supporters in alt-right digital spaces. In this essay, we analyze one of the online forums that helped propel Trump to electoral victory. Drawing on social movement concepts and an analysis of 1,762 posts, we show how leaders of the forum the “Red Pill” were able to move a community of adherents from understanding men’s rights as a personal philosophy to political action. This transition was no small endeavor. The Red Pill forum was explicitly apolitical until the summer before the 2016 election. During the election, forum leaders linked the forum’s neoliberal, misogynistic collective identity of alpha masculinity to Trump’s public persona and framed his political ascendance as an opportunity to effectively push back against feminism and get a “real” man into the White House. We argue that while previous research shows the importance of alt-right virtual spaces in creating and maintaining racist collective identities, we know very little about how men conceptualize gender in ways that inform their personal and political action—and this is to our detriment. We conclude the essay by arguing that feminists need to understand how men cultivate extreme personal and political identities in online forums so that we can better understand how new technologies are used to move individuals from the armchair to the streets.},

This article investigates media practices in the Occupy movement and develops the concept of social movement media cultures: the set of tools, skills, social practices and norms that movement participants deploy to create, circulate, curate and amplify movement media across all available platforms. The article posits three key areas of inquiry into social movement media cultures, and explores them through the lens of the Occupy movement: (1) What media platforms, tools and skills are used most widely by movement participants? (Practices); (2) What role do experienced practitioners play in movement media practices? (Expertise); and (3) In what ways does the movement media culture lean toward open or participatory, and in what ways toward closed or top–down? (Open/Closed). Insight into the media culture of the Occupy movement is based on mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, participant observation, visual research and participation in Occupy Hackathons, as well as the Occupy Research General Demographic and Political Participation Survey, a database of approximately 1200 local Occupy sites, and a dataset of more than 13 million Occupy-related tweets. The findings will be of interest to both scholars and movement participants.},

But the story gained attention and controversy over Martin’s death dominated headlines, airwaves, and Twitter for months, thanks to a savvy publicist working on behalf of the victim’s parents and a series of campaigns offline and online. Using the theories of networked gatekeeping and networked framing, we map out the vast media ecosystem using quantitative data about the content generated around the Trayvon Martin story in both offline and online media, as well as measures of engagement with the story, to trace the interrelations among mainstream media, nonprofessional and social media, and their audiences. We consider the attention and link economies among the collected media sources in order to understand who was influential when, finding that broadcast media is still important as an amplifier and gatekeeper, but that it is susceptible to media activists working through participatory or nonprofessional media to co-create the news and influence the framing of major controversies. Our findings have implications for social change organizations that seek to harness advocacy campaigns to news stories, and for scholars studying media ecology and the networked public sphere.},

Our analysis documents the eventful history of changing digital repertoires of contention in the context of messaging, blogging, and social networking sites in Iran. We argue that investigating single moments of protest offers only snapshots of how digital technologies are used in contentious politics, and entails the risk of focusing on a single platform rather than the mosaic of online and offline repertoires. We demonstrate that documenting event histories challenges the assumptions of the emancipatory nature of a specific technology by revealing the changing efficacy of repertoires during different moments of contention; therefore, we should avoid assigning stable causal relations between digital technologies and the democratization processes of societies.},

	abstract = {This article develops a conceptual framework for understanding collective action in the age of social media, focusing on the role of collective identity and the process of its making. It is grounded on an interactionist approach that considers organized collective action as a social construct with communicative action at its core [Melucci, A. 1996. Challenging codes: Collective action in the information age. Cambridge, MA: Cambridge University Press]. It explains how micromobilization is mediated by social media, and argues that social media play a novel broker role in the activists' meaning construction processes. Social media impose precise material constraints on their social affordances, which have profound implications in both the symbolic production and organizational dynamics of social action. The materiality of social media deeply affects identity building, in two ways: firstly, it amplifies the ‘interactive and shared’ elements of collective identity (Melucci, 1996), and secondly, it sets in motion a politics of visibility characterized by individuality, performance, visibility, and juxtaposition. The politics of visibility, at the heart of what I call ‘cloud protesting’, exacerbates the centrality of the subjective and private experience of the individual in contemporary mobilizations, and has partially replaced the politics of identity typical of social movements. The politics of visibility creates individuals-in-the-group, whereby the ‘collective’ is experienced through the ‘individual’ and the group is the means of collective action, rather than its end.},

These questions are of fundamental importance to scholars of social movements, contentious politics, and political behavior generally. However, little prior work has systematically addressed the role of images in mobilizing online participation in social movements. We first confirm that images have a positive mobilizing effect in the context of online protest activity. We then argue that images are mobilizing because they trigger stronger emotional reactions than text. Building on existing political psychology models, we theorize that images evoking enthusiasm, anger, and fear should be particularly mobilizing, while sadness should be demobilizing. We test the argument through a study of Twitter activity related to a Black Lives Matter protest. We find that both images in general and some of the proposed emotional attributes (enthusiasm and fear) contribute to online participation. The results hold when controlling for alternative theoretical mechanisms for why images should be mobilizing, and for the presence of frequent image features. Our paper provides evidence supporting the broad argument that images increase the likelihood of a protest to spread online while teasing out the mechanisms at play in a new media environment.},

	abstract = {Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag \#BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to \#BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted \#AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis of over 860,000 tweets, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. We find that \#AllLivesMatter facilitates opposition between \#BlackLivesMatter and hashtags such as \#PoliceLivesMatter and \#BlueLivesMatter in such a way that historically echoes the tension between Black protesters and law enforcement. In addition, we show that a significant portion of \#AllLivesMatter use stems from hijacking by \#BlackLivesMatter advocates. Beyond simply injecting \#AllLivesMatter with \#BlackLivesMatter content, these hijackers use the hashtag to directly confront the counter-protest notion of “All lives matter.” Our findings suggest that Black Lives Matter movement was able to grow, exhibit diverse conversations, and avoid derailment on social media by making discussion of counter-protest opinions a central topic of \#AllLivesMatter, rather than the movement itself.},

This study develops and measures three theoretically grounded metrics of social media power—unity, numbers, and commitment—as wielded on Twitter by a social movement (Black Lives Matter [BLM]), a counter-movement (political conservatives), and an unaligned party (mainstream news outlets) over nearly 10 months. We find evidence of a model of social media efficacy in which BLM predicts mainstream news coverage of police brutality, which in turn is the strongest driver of attention to the issue from political elites. Critically, the metric that best predicts elite response across all parties is commitment.},

And two, what influence do the technological infrastructures in which they operate have on their formation, structure, and activities? For this, we differentiate between two main types of social collectives: non-organized collectives, which exhibit loosely coupled collective behavior, and collective actors with a separate identity and strategic capability. Further, we examine the newness, or distinctive traits, of online-based collectives, which we identify as being the strong and hitherto non-existent interplay between the technological infrastructures that these collectives are embedded in and the social processes of coordination and institutionalization they must engage in, in order to maintain their viability over time. Conventional patterns of social dynamics in the development and stabilization of collective action are now systematically intertwined with technology-induced processes of structuration.},

	abstract = {This study examines the phenomenon of politically motivated selective avoidance on Facebook in the context of the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement protests in 2014. We conceptualize selective avoidance as individual choices that users make to shield themselves from undesirable dissonant views by removing unwanted information and breaking social ties that transmit such information. Given the political turmoil and high level of polarization during the protests, we argue that selective avoidance was related to the socio-psychological factor of perceived out-group threat. We present an analysis of a survey of 769 students from Hong Kong conducted at the height of the street protests. We find that 15.6\% of the respondents removed content and/or unfriended a Facebook friend during the protests. The use of Facebook for protest-related information and expression was associated with higher likelihood of selective avoidance, which in turn predicted actual participation in the street protests. The level of perceived out-group threat strengthened the positive relationship between Facebook use and selective avoidance. We thus argue that group conflict in a time of political turmoil may catalyze selective avoidance, transforming a heterogeneous socio-informational environment into a more insulated gated community. Such acts may promote protest participation but also lead to a more fragmented and polarized citizenry.},

This article addresses these challenges as a theoretical undertaking. It argues that the digital media environment should be understood as a change in the context for action rather than as an individual-level variable, and that this changed context is relevant to behavior because it expands opportunities for action. This expansion involves a range of structural possibilities for viable collective action that entail at least three paths: organizational prompts, social prompts, and self-initiation. There are theoretical reasons to expect that individual-level attributes including age, education, ideology, and personality may differentially affect people’s susceptibility to these prompts. Future research may profit from refinements to behavioral models that account for possible differences across structurally different prompts for action.},

More specifically, it proposes that Facebook and Twitter are conducive to protest behavior through two distinct mechanisms: whereas the influence of Facebook use is more effective through communication with strong-tie networks, the impact of Twitter use is more effective through communication with weak-tie networks. To test these expectations, we analyze data from a cross-sectional, face-to-face survey on a representative sample of Chilean youths conducted in 2014. Findings in the study lend empirical support for these hypotheses. Consequently, while different social media (in this case, Facebook and Twitter) are similar in their participatory effects, the paths through which this influence occurs are distinct, a finding that highlights the importance of studying political behavior across different media platforms.},

As platforms multiply, the media environment itself has become more complicated, as classic understandings of media ecology give way to a growing recognition of the hybrid media system. In studying political communication across platforms, we can better understand what types of experiences and effects are universal, and which are specific to a particular platform. This special issue highlights the diverse methods needed to study a complex media environment and the nuance and richness of understanding we gain by doing so. We urge researchers to extend their research outside of a single platform, to consider the context and affordances of multiple platforms, and to focus on a more ecological approach to the modern media environment.},

We analyse 25 million photos uploaded to Flickr in 2013 across 244 countries and regions, and determine for each week in each country and region what proportion of the photographs are tagged with the word “protest” in 34 different languages. We find that higher proportions of “protest”-tagged photographs in a given country and region in a given week correspond to greater numbers of reports of protests in that country and region and week in the newspaper The Guardian. Our findings underline the potential value of photographs uploaded to the Internet as a source of global, cheap and rapidly available measurements of human behaviour in the real world.},

	abstract = {This book examines the representation of blackness on television at the height of the southern civil rights movement and again in the aftermath of the Reagan-Bush years. In the process, it looks carefully at how television's ideological projects with respect to race have supported or conflicted with the industry's incentive to maximize profits or consolidate power. Sasha Torres examines the complex relations between the television industry and the civil rights movement as a knot of overlapping interests. She argues that television coverage of the civil rights movement during 1955-1965 encouraged viewers to identify with black protestors and against white police, including such infamous villains as Birmingham's Bull Connor and Selma's Jim Clark. Torres then argues that television of the 1990s encouraged viewers to identify with police against putatively criminal blacks, even in its dramatizations of police brutality. Torres's pioneering analysis makes distinctive contributions to its fields. It challenges television scholars to consider the historical centrality of race to the constitution of the medium's genres, visual conventions, and industrial structures. And it displaces the analytical focus on stereotypes that has hamstrung assessments of television's depiction of African Americans, concentrating instead on the ways in which African Americans and their political collectives have actively shaped that depiction to advance civil rights causes. This book also challenges African American studies to pay closer and better attention to television's ongoing role in the organization and disorganization of U.S. racial politics.},

Using historical data on textile manufacturing concentration and strike activity, FCC data on radio station foundings, and analyses of political content and song lyrics, the authors show that the geographic proximity of radio stations to the "textile belt" and the messages aired shaped workers' sense of collective experience and political opportunity: Walk-outs and strike spillover across mill towns resulted. The implications of the analyses for social movement theory generally, and for the understanding of how media can enable or constrain collective struggle, are discussed.},

We model the consequences of demonstration form, context, and purpose on the likelihood of media coverage. The estimated size of a demonstration and its importance to the current media issue attention cycle are the strongest predictors of its coverage. Additional analyses support our claim that heightened media attention to an issue increases the likelihood that protests related to that issue will be covered. Comparing 1982 to 1991 suggests that television coverage of protests is increasingly subject to the impact of media issue attention cycles.},

The "hard news" of the event, if it is reported, tends to be relatively accurate. However, a newspaper's decision to cover an event at all is influenced by the type of event, the news agency, and the issue involved. In this review, we discuss approaches to detecting bias, as well as ways to factor knowledge about bias into interpretations of protest event data.

By drawing attention to movements’ issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers’ focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.},

While early scholarship focused on grand debates, such as whether and to what extent existing social movement theory could address challenges raised by ICTs, more recent research focuses on more meso-level questions familiar to many social movement scholars, such as how ICT usage can affect repression and the effectiveness of digital protest. Continuing debates involve the kinds of cases that should be studied, how to generalize from those cases, and how to understand the hybridity of physical and screen worlds.},

Reporting by newspapers is, however, known to be strongly affected by selection bias. Newspapers report events that they find "newsworthy." Surprisingly, the effect of these selection biases on data analyses has received scant attention, and the methodology to correct for these biases hardly has been discussed. Based on data covering events in four cities in Switzerland we propose two types of corrections for the selection bias. The first is based on a simple weighting scheme for events reported in local newspapers. These weights are likely to provide useful corrections even in other contexts. The second correction attempts to model explicitly the selection bias of the media. This truncated regression approach is shown to be a useful strategy when the selectivity by the newspapers is severe, and the factors affecting this selection are largely known.},

The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it. The study examines these two principles using political, media, and protest data from twenty Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority.

Looking at the underlying theories, histories, politics, ideologies, tactics, strategies, and aesthetics, the book takes an expansive view of media activism. It explores how varieties of activism are mediated through communication technologies, how activists deploy strategies for changing the structures of media systems, and how governments and corporations seek to police media activism. From memes to zines, hacktivism to artivism, this volume considers activist practices involving both older kinds of media and newer digital, social, and network-based forms.

Like many other contemporary protest forms in China and the world, Yang argues, Chinese online activism derives its methods and vitality from multiple and intersecting forces, and state efforts to constrain it have only led to more creative acts of subversion. Transnationalism and the tradition of protest in China's incipient civil society provide cultural and social resources to online activism. Even Internet businesses have encouraged contentious activities, generating an unusual synergy between commerce and activism.

Social media can potentially change or contribute to the political communication, mobilization, and organization of social movements. To what extent did these three movements use social media in such ways? To answer this question a comparative content analysis of tweets sent during the heydays of each of the campaigns is conducted. The results indicate that, although Twitter was used significantly for political discussion and to communicate protest information, calls for participation were not predominant. Only a very small minority of tweets referred to protest organization and coordination issues. Furthermore, comparing the actual content of the Twitter information exchanges reveals similarities as well as differences among the three movements, which can be explained by the different national contexts.},

A midwestern professor of Middle Eastern history starts a blog after 9/11 that becomes essential reading for journalists covering the Iraq war. Activists use the Internet and e-mail to bring offensive comments made by Trent Lott and Don Imus to a wide public and hound them from their positions. A few people find that a world-class online encyclopedia created entirely by volunteers and open for editing by anyone, a wiki, is not an impractical idea. Jihadi groups trade inspiration and instruction and showcase terrorist atrocities to the world, entirely online. A wide group of unrelated people swarms to a Web site about the theft of a cell phone and ultimately goads the New York City police to take action, leading to the culprit's arrest.  With accelerating velocity, our age's new technologies of social networking are evolving, and evolving us, into new groups doing new things in new ways, and old and new groups alike doing the old things better and more easily. You don't have to have a MySpace page to know that the times they are a changin'. Hierarchical structures that exist to manage the work of groups are seeing their raisons d'Âtre swiftly eroded by the rising technological tide. Business models are being destroyed, transformed, born at dizzying speeds, and the larger social impact is profound.  One of the culture's wisest observers of the transformational power of the new forms of tech-enabled social interaction is Clay Shirky, and Here Comes Everybody is his marvelous reckoning with the ramifications of all this on what we do and who we are. Like Lawrence Lessig on the effect of new technology on regimes of cultural creation, Shirky's assessment of the impact of new technology on the nature and use of groups is marvelously broad minded, lucid, and penetrating; it integrates the views of a number of other thinkers across a broad range of disciplines with his own pioneering work to provide a holistic framework for understanding the opportunities and the threats to the existing order that these new, spontaneous networks of social interaction represent.

The internet has been hailed as a leveling force that is reshaping activism. From the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter and \#MeToo, digital activism seemed cheap, fast, and open to all. Now this celebratory narrative finds itself competing with an increasingly sinister story as platforms like Facebook and Twitter--once the darlings of digital democracy--are on the defensive for their role in promoting fake news. While hashtag activism captures headlines, conservative digital activism is proving more effective on the ground. In this sharp-eyed and counterintuitive study, Jen Schradie shows how the web has become another weapon in the arsenal of the powerful. She zeroes in on workers' rights advocacy in North Carolina and finds a case study with broad implications. North Carolina's hard-right turn in the early 2010s should have alerted political analysts to the web's antidemocratic potential: amid booming online organizing, one of the country's most closely contested states elected the most conservative government in North Carolina's history. The Revolution That Wasn't identifies the reasons behind this previously undiagnosed digital-activism gap. Large hierarchical political organizations with professional staff can amplify their digital impact, while horizontally organized volunteer groups tend to be less effective at translating online goodwill into meaningful action. Not only does technology fail to level the playing field, it tilts it further, so that only the most sophisticated and well-funded players can compete.},

Using data on public demonstrations in Swiss cities, collected from press and police sources, this article examines how newspapers fare with regard to validity and reliability problems. Newspaper data are shown to result from a combination of news values shared by the journalistic profession and a cultural reproduction process. The first mechanism induces invalid but reliable bias. However, the second creates more problems of comparability across time and space. After having discussed the dominant strategies of data collection, the authors suggest several practical solutions aimed at minimizing and/or neutralizing the problem of bias in newspaper data.},

Based on extensive surveys and interviews with members of three influential and distinctive organizations in the United States - The American Legion, AARP, and MoveOn - the authors reconceptualize collective action as a phenomenon in which technology enhances people's ability to cross boundaries in order to interact with one another and engage with organizations. By developing a theory of Collective Action Space, Bimber, Flanagin, and Stohl explore how people's attitudes, behaviors, motivations, goals, and digital media use are related to their organizational involvement. They find that using technology does not necessarily make people more likely to act collectively, but contributes to a diversity of "participatory styles," which hinge on people's interaction with one another and the extent to which they shape organizational agendas. In the digital media age, organizations do not simply recruit people into roles, they provide contexts in which people are able to construct their own collective experiences.},

While these and similar social movements differ in many important ways, there is one thing they share in common: they are all interwoven inextricably with the creation of autonomous communication networks supported by the Internet and wireless communication.   In this new edition of his timely and important book, Manuel Castells examines the social, cultural and political roots of these new social movements, studies their innovative forms of self-organization, assesses the precise role of technology in the dynamics of the movements, suggests the reasons for the support they have found in large segments of society, and probes their capacity to induce political change by influencing people’s minds. Two new chapters bring the analysis up-to-date and draw out the implications of these social movements and protests for understanding the new forms of social change and political democracy in the global network society.},

An incisive observer, writer, and participant in today’s social movements, Zeynep Tufekci explains in this accessible and compelling book the nuanced trajectories of modern protests—how they form, how they operate differently from past protests, and why they have difficulty persisting in their long-term quests for change.   Tufekci speaks from direct experience, combining on-the-ground interviews with insightful analysis. She describes how the internet helped the Zapatista uprisings in Mexico, the necessity of remote Twitter users to organize medical supplies during Arab Spring, the refusal to use bullhorns in the Occupy Movement that started in New York, and the empowering effect of tear gas in Istanbul’s Gezi Park. These details from life inside social movements complete a moving investigation of authority, technology, and culture—and offer essential insights into the future of governance.},

Introduction:
RQ: What do digital technologies mean for how social movements, power, and society interact? (xviii). What are the effects of digital technologies on social movements and public sphere? What are the challenges that movements face when using social media platforms?
-areas: networked activism; social media v.s. traditional media; leaderless v.s. hierarchical structure; weak ties v.s. strong ties; affordances provided by social media; addressing "slactivism"; government surveillance and control of public sphere; ad-financed algorithmns/platforms; echo chambers; doxing
Goals:
Theories:
Methods and Data:
Sections:
Ch 1: Networked Public Sphere (3)
CCs:
1) Digital technologies have expanded our sense of community, identity, and the public sphere, allowing us to connect to many millions regardless of physical distance. Facebook is a prime example, which enables the political activation of strong and weak ties. Digital technologies are placed in the context of other technologies like writing, mass media, and places like coffee houses and salons.
2) Challenges notion of "slactivism" by Morozov because usually people usually learn more about issues and sometimes become more involved once learns about them.
Notes:
Benedict Anderson (4) - mass media and unification of dialects into languages; argument for a networked public sphere afforded by new 21st century social media technologies (6-7), part of other technologies like writing, newspapers, transportation; movements and governments try to influence the public sphere, and hence this digital one (8); social media expands affordances of how and in what frequency and with whom ppl can interact (11)
-importance of social media: getting the word out and circumventing attempts by authoritarian government from silencing and censoring protests (14-6); slacktivism - one-sided and overly simplistic view of internet activism [Evgeny Morozov] (16-7); Facebook's affordances: mass userbase, connectivity, open and non-private, networking of weak ties, signaling of likes, comments, and to-go to events (20-1), e.g. of Egyptian Tahrir Square protest Jan 25 2011
Ch 2: Censorship and Attention (28)
CCs:
1) Attention as a vital resource for social movements. Censorship attempts through multiple means to deny attention to movements.
2) Social media enables movements and citizen journalists to bypass media censorship and other gatekeepers. But, this also opens up new problems of credibility/verification of information and processing vast information.
-censorship, media attention, and role of digital technologies as intermediaries for public sphere; implementation of social media-{\textgreater} no longer mass media dominated, media gatekeepers, instead user-content but also gatekeepers in other areas (rules of certain platforms) (29)
-media attention: a resource vital for social movements; distributed across various spaces and attempts to censor by governments (30); used to be monopoly by mass media so movements compete to obtain attention; but no longer so because of social media (31), e.g. of 2013 Gerzi Park protests in Turkey - competing social media by student citizen media network v.s. corporate media in favor of government; and on mass media coverage of the Kurds (33-5); mass media blacks out protest but social media boosts attention international level, generates networked public sphere (46-7)
-role of new media and public sphere: does not replace old media, but integrates with it; creates more open environment but informal and formal gatekeepers still remain (39) -- problem of too much information, each with different reach, attention and credibility (39)--though mass media still has its biases, e.g. of citizen media group in Turkey 140journos that tries to filter and verify abundant information  (42-3)
ch 3: Leading the Leaderless (49)
CCs:
1) Digital tools enabled activists to organize movement infrastructure and logistics (ad hoc manner) very quickly. This allows them to build organizing capacity from zero to full very quickly, whereas in the past movements tooks months and years to build capacity. Tufekci calls these "network internalities" (75)
2) But, digital tools can create a weakness: difficult to make tacticial shifts, tactical freeze, co-optation (with no formal leaders).
-how networked protests organize
-digital tools provide affordances for small group of ppl to organize and do work and maintain movement w/o organization (53) - "adhocracy", anti-authoritarian and left movements (53), e.g. of four regular activists from over world to organize twitter account @TahrirSupplies and coordinate relief efforts (55)
-movement logistics and infrastructure as not often covered by media (60-61), prominent e.g. of Montgomery bus boycott (61-6) and March on Washington (66-) as logistic and organizing projects; signal of movement capacity to leaders
-DIFFERENCE between 21st social media movements and previous movements -{\textgreater} previously had to build organizing capacity first to generate large-scale actions, newer movements not have to develop organizing capacity and can scale up logistical tasks very quickly using existing infrastructure (70); but comes with weaknesses: 1) tactical shifts difficult, 2) unable to negotiate collectively, 3) fails to signal organizing capacity to authorities (71), e.g. of lack of consolidated goals by Gerzi Park occupiers (73-5)
-network internalities: "Network internalities are the benefits and collective capabilities attained duringthe process of forming durable networks which occur regardless of what the task is, or how trivial it may seem, as long as it poses challenges that must be overcome collectively and require decision making, buildingof trust, and delegation among a semidurable network of people who interact over time" (75); muscles needed to build for movement; relying on technology can underdevelop these internalities (76-7)
-tactical freeze: not able to change tactics b/c of lack of structure, organizing capacity (77), inability to advance movement agenda (80-1)
-co-optation: social media creates new online "attention economy" of de facto spokesppl [ but Jo Freeman already said this in Tyranny of Structurelessness ] (79) '
Ch 4: Movement Cultures (83)
CCs:
1) Many participants in these social media movements share a similar protest culture that connects them together through social ties, friendships, solidarity despite vast differences in identity (nationalist, religious)--usually anti-authoritarian, distrust of authorities.
2) "Collective effervescence" (Durkheim) as expressive feelings that make people participate altruistically at protest camps (e.g. of making libraries at camps). Protests as communities--full of meaning making and ritual creation.
-how does the protest culture of anti-authoritarian, networked movements employ digital technologies
-presents a political culture of anti-authorian, digital-tool wielding, leaderless, expressive politics that brings together vast diverse ppl (86)
-why do ppl engage in protests? protest as an expressive form of being a part of something bigger (collective effervescence) [Durkheim on elementary forms and religion ] (89); type of culture shapes the protest activity they take (90); e.g. of building libraries in occupations in OWS and Gerzi Park, ppl exchange books outside of capitalism, commodity-fetishism (Karl Marx) (91-2); protest becomes a community (103-5), and brings together diverse array of ppl, identities, ideologies (105)
-but has problems with this culture: not able to agree and follow through on course of action (95); power held by few who can override majority, esp. loudest voices (98, 100); assembly format excludes many ppl
-digital technologies facilitate these types of protest communities (110-2)
[Tufecki does not go into how do non-consesnsus cultures employ social media? ]
Ch 5: Technology and People
CCs:
1) Technology does have societal-ecological effects through its affordances, but this does not lead to determined behavior (i.e. "technodeterminism"). Instead, it nudges people to certain kinds of behavior, but not in a uniform manner. Technology also does not create a dualism between "virtual" and "real" world, as both are real.
2) There are four types of causes, according to Aristotle: material (substrate), formal (arrangement), efficient (act that brings about change), and final (purpose of act). While most people focus on efficient and final, technology also affects material and formal. There are also "necessary and sufficient" causes to consider. Is technology a necessary and sufficient cause for protest?
3) But technology is not just a tool. Technology have "efficiencies" and "potencies" that affect/shift existing relations in society. There is also the social construction of technology, which limits of technology based on social-economic decisions made on design process, mathematical laws, financial incentives, etc.--they are not infinite.
-not dualism between virtual and "real" world; online world also not exact reflections of offline world; technology is not creating novel behavior
Ch 6: Platforms and Algorithms (133)
CCs:
1) Social media has shifted gatekeepers to internet platforms' policies, algorithms, and affordances. They have dominated this world because of network externality effects and aggressive ad-financing model. Companies shape the rules and affordances by which these platforms function, whether good or bad for activists
2) Using Facebook as an example, the effects of these platforms has shaped activism in various ways, e.g. shutting down accounts, requiring formal names (not pseudonyms). Community policing allows targeting activists for spam and reporting them. Usually, these content/user policing is complex because Facebook operates under a variety of international, national, commercial, etc. legal regimes. Decisions are made without public transparency.
3) Algorithms, with rules not transparent, shapes what gets on each person's newsfeed. This can be detrimental for activists.
-why only some social media platforms dominate public sphere; what do they mean for social movements?
-around mid 2000s, networked public sphere shifts from individual blogs to corporate-controlled/commercial social media platforms (134); shift of gatekeeping from traditional news to social media platforms (138)
-two structural dynamics, network externalities (more ppl, more useful) and ad-financing model (monitor user data and finance tailored ads)-{\textgreater} dominance of a few online platform (135-7)
-each platform's specific policies have consequential effects for movements, repression, and affordances offered; each becomes its own gatekeeper, e.g. Facebook's real-name policy (139) and community policing model (143); also no simple mechanism for censorship policies among online platforms (146-8), dilemmas between newsworthiness v.s. propaganda (152); role of government in colluding with online platforms to repress dissidents (153)
-algorithms that platforms use prioritize/bury certain postings but not others (154), e.g. Facebook algorithm determines what you see (156), and it is opaque and hidden from public (160) though it has potential for large effects on ppl's behavior
ch 7: Names and Connections (164)
CCs:
1) Digital affordances in various online platforms shapes ground rules of interactions. These interact with pre-existing human dynamics of homophily, networks, and status.
2) The effects of anonymity can allow people to express themselves and connect to other people freely in pseudo-anonymous communities--creating different sub-cultures.
3) Some social media platforms enable "doxing" and organized harassing of public figures and activists and journalists (esp. on twitter, which enables pseudo anonymity and public figures). This also allows people to pretend to be activists
4) Owners of social media platforms are ill-suited to combat this, from legal, policy, and technological standpoints, e.g. free speech/censorship, maintaining financial profit, difficult to just ban bots, determining what is considered hate speech
ch 8: Signaling Power and Signaling to Power (189)
CCs:
1) Movements have power though signaling capacities to those who have power. Capacities mean collective ability of movements. Tufekci describes three capacities: narrative, electoral/institutional, disruptive capacities.
2) Movements communicate, indirectly and directly, to decision makers through signals. Signals can be expensive or inexpensive, and can be interpreted and misinterpreted.
3) Social media enables the proliferation of signaled narrative capacity, but it can be used to organize electoral/institutional and disruptive ones as well. Social media can also be used to bypass mass media outlets.
 
-capacities and signals theory about social movements; why do some movements and not others have impact on agents of change?
-CAPACITIES: collective ability to set changes/potential rather than just outcomes/benchmarks; to set agenda, to affect institutional changes, to disrupt [Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum] (191-2); 1) narrative capacity -- shape worldview, affect media (193-4), 2) disruptive capacity -- interrupt business as sual, amke point, sustain it (197-9) , 3) institutional/electoral capacity -- threaten politicians/policy makers [in electoral systems] (196); different capacities do not have to grow at same rate
-SIGNALS: to those in power; cheap/costly signals (200-1); role of social movements is to signal capacities to leaders
-role of digital tools on signaling capacities: creates new environment and arena of contestation where strenghten, alter, and weaken capacities (203); social media generally enhances narrative capacity (204-5), e.g. of BLM movement employing social meida (207-9), e.g. of OWS (209-16), Tea Party, and anti-SOPA
Ch 9: Governments Strike Back (223)
CCs:
1) Social media changes the landscape of media and communications censorship. Sometimes, fumbled attempts at censorship/blackout backfire, so governments must be more sophisticated in censorship strategies--to deny attention and focus, sow confusion, delegitimize media. Another is government surveillance, using these new technologies to spy on, threaten, target activists.
2) Cases of strategies: China + Iran's own online media infrastructure, split off internet from others in the world; Russia employs paid trolls to spread disinformation. In general, these disinformation is not new (i.e. mass media lied as well), but the scale opens up more public intervention into creating and sharing fake news.
3) A flip side: activist and citizen journalism challenge to convince audience of authenticity and verification of reports.
-how governments have reacted to networked movements to maintain control of public sphere
-digital tools also give affordances for government to employ digital tools as surveillance, control public sphere, squash opposition (226); also allows anyone to post, so public sphere becomes more chaotic and less coherent, fewer gatekeepers (240)
-Streisand effect (228) -{\textgreater} when draconian censorship actually produces backlash, so instead governments employs and reframes public sphere
-CENSORSHIP: not just blocking information from action/will/agency (as worked in past), but instead target to weaken agency (229); new technologies have allowed ways to circumvent attempts at cutting off information, so instead governments try to control public sphere; methods include censorship, wait-and-see, distraction and disinformation campaigns (237-41), demonizing the entire medium (241), lack of credible intermediaries, discredit intermediaries (244), and sowing doubt (250)
-e.g. of China meticulously censors and controls messaging in public sphere (232)
-government engages in surveillance (251): track individual activists online; informants, targeting personal lives of activists
Epilogue (261)
CCs:
1) Social media challenges the power of gatekeepers in the media. This has led to activists employing citizen journalism and mobilization against censored traditional news and dictators. But, this has also led to proliferation of fake news.
2) Tufekci introduces some terms to understand social movement mobilization, including capacities, signals, tactical freeze, and attention
3) Yet, the powerful can employ digital tools to paralyze any social movement mobilization--"censorship via blocking" (274)
-technology neither good or bad, nor it is neutral-{\textgreater} technology provides opportunities and changes environment
-movements possess signals and capacities (narrative, disruptive, institutional); anti-authoritarian movements employ social media, but also their culture generates a specific type of organizing (270)
-social media provides new platforms and new affordances -{\textgreater} from disseminating scarce information to managing and verifying a deluge of information; commercial gatekeepers (272); new ways that governments can stifle and repress movements -{\textgreater} using social media to target/spy on individuals, disseminate counter-information, and control public sphere

In this study, the earliest Twitter messages regarding \#OccupyWallStreet were subjected to network analysis to answer these questions: What were the central hubs in the OWS discourse on Twitter in the summer of 2011?

What were the key points in the Twitter dialogue that aided the process of scale shift? By addressing these questions, this research connects social movement concepts with network centrality measures to provide a clearer picture of movements in the digital era.},

	abstract = {There is an elaborate and often invisible carnival that emerges alongside presidential campaigns as innumerable activist groups attempt to press their issues into mainstream political discourse. Sarah Sobieraj’s fascinating ethnographic portrait of fifty diverse organizations over the course of two campaign cycles reveals that while most activist groups equate political success with media success and channel their energies accordingly, their efforts fail to generate news coverage and come with deleterious consequences. Sobieraj shows that activists’ impact on public political debates is minimal, and carefully unravels the ways in which their all-consuming media work and unrelenting public relations approach undermine their ability to communicate with pedestrians, comes at the expense of other political activities, and perhaps most perniciously, damages the groups themselves.Weaving together fieldwork, news analysis, and in-depth interviews with activists and journalists, Soundbitten illuminates the relationship between news and activist organizations. This captivating portrait of activism in the United States lays bare the challenges faced by outsiders struggling to be heard in a mass media dominated public sphere that proves exclusionary and shows that media-centrism is not only ineffective, but also damaging to group life. Soundbitten reveals why media-centered activism so often fails, what activist groups lose in the process, and why we should all be concerned.},

RQ:
-how is it that activists can organize yet media ignores them? Yet at same time other groups leverage political events as windows of opportunity?
-it is journalistic perceptions (of authenticity and coherent messaging) that is most important in the media's ignoring activists; activist media-centrism strategy is therefore unproductive (unsuccessful in generating substantive coverage) and detrimental to movement organization
Theories:
-story of voluntary associations, mass media, and presidential campaigns
-civil society - space of civic participation and voluntary organizations/associations, place of consensus and conflcit
-public sphere - practice of open discussion in variety of mediums
-mobilization - level, intensity, and mode of movement activity taken (11, 13); mobilization plays role in bringing together civil society and the public sphere (12), how does this work shape civil society, group life?
- fundamental, communal, demonstrative modes and typical v.s mobilized levels (14), 2-by-2 table
Methods and Data:
-presidential campaigns: incite public sphere with windows of opportunity (5)
-ethnographic fieldwork at voluntary association events 2000 and 2004 during Democratic and Republic conventions in: LA, Philadelphia, Boston, NYC; and televised presidential addresses of 2000 in Boston, Winston-Salem, and St Louis; diverse array of fifty orgs observed; 125 interviews with group representatives (15-6)
Findings:
-most orgs chose demonstrative, outward orientation to specially change discourse and change the news (17); focus most organizing attention to garnering media attention rather than other org work (17); rarely get mainstream media coverage, and media-centered strategy was detrimental to movement; changes association culture into disciplining members, detrimental to group life
1) mass media is gatekeeper blocking voluntary associations from access to public sphere and political arena
2) strategies by voluntary associations to gain access to public sphere are detrimental and ineffective
[my own extensions - social media data; build on this research that looks at perils of garnering media attention as a strategy of social movement mobilization; did BLM actively seek mainstream media attention? Or other way around?
-BLM seems to be engaging in tactics as direct response to events, rather than as political opportunities to attract media attention; media coverage as a result? Can I come up with a test about this? ]
Ch 2: Campaign Events as Catalysts: Politicization of Public Space 
-why associations use campaign events for activism; and why they are media centered
-snapshots of political activity in different cities-{\textgreater}all trying to insert in public sphere via demonstrative activity (35), not to support candidates (38-42) but to create discussion on own local issues, inclusion and tunnel vision towards attracting media attention (47) to an abstract audience + influence public opinion(50)
Ch 3: Streets as Stage: The many faces of publicity
-chapter provides case studies of demonstrative tactics used to attract media attention: street theater, motivational speaking v.s. non-demonstrative actions like community building
Ch 4: Journalists, Activists, and the Battle over news
-how news content becomes negotiated, organizational consequences of media-centered activism
-context of mass media in public sphere and public discourse (86-89)
-why media not cover activists? Because of unwritten rules of coverage of outsiders, journalistic norms, etc. in covering political news (71) [ suggests endogenous characteristics of journalists ]
-methods: newspaper coverage from LexisNexis of 92 articles on 45 associations
-findings: many mentions of SM orgs, but content is skimpy and more detailed coverage as disparaging and treatment of public spectacle (72-76)
-factors that shape coverage: organization of news production (state-centered) (80), routines of news works (81), event characteristics (mostly size) (81), subjective characteristics of whether event is determined newsworthy (82)
-Sobieraj describes set of factors journalists were looking for: authenticity (esp. of authentic individuals/activists (91) of conflict, actually events rather than nonevents and substance is logistics of protest (91)) (83), must be politically reasonable w/ single coherent message (96) [ how media pigeon-holes groups? ]
-activists + associations that tried to adopt professional journalistic norms failed to attract attention; media strategy rather than political strategy (105-6); resources put in are detrimental to organization
Ch 5: Pushing Bystanders out of the way
-failures of face-to-face, direct outreach to bystanders in effort to attract media attention in soundbytes; poor encounters with layppl
Ch 6:bittersweet residues of mobilization
-effects of mobilization/campaigns on participants; mobilization effects on media coverage
-finds organization strains in resources (131) and costs in restricting internal discourse in orgs (134) -{\textgreater}managing members, focus on single issues to not talk about divisive issues, political discourse as inefficient
-some positive benefits of media-centered activism: expand bases of support (orgs and members), (153), collaboration among orgs (154), made many participants feel energized, efficacious, developed collective identity (156)
-distinction between media strategy and political strategy (165)
Ch7: on ICTs and the 2008 election
-ICTs provide new opportunity for media-centered content and mobilizations, functions alongside new media [ interesting that 2008 election -{\textgreater} new media and social media craze; 2011 Arab Spring +OWS + 2013 Trayvon and BLM -{\textgreater} social media interest; 2016 election -{\textgreater} overwhelming criticism of social media as fake news ]
 
-Sobieraj: under conditions of 1) mobilization: high, demonstrative, media-centered movement activity, 2) journalistic perceptions: low authenticity/no coherent message, and 3) infrastructure: no ICTs and social media -{\textgreater} movement activity
[my research looks at the content analysis part of media coverage of movements; this looks at media-movement relations in terms of media-centered activism (media strategy v.s. political strategy); BLM not appear to be media-centered, and they are also creating their own content on new media ICTs, social media; I want to see comparison of their new media with news media? 1) I want to look at under what circumstances do media co-opt v.s. cover movement messaging and 2) under what circumstances do media cover movements themselves ] my research 1) looks more into role of ICTs as media strategy while Sobieraj's research looks at just mass media and 2) I focus more on content analysis of coverage},

Then, the author examines whether Twitter sentiment represents the gender attitudes of diverse populations by predicting the effect of Twitter sentiment on individuals’ gender attitudes across race, gender, and education level. The results indicate that Twitter sentiment toward feminism is highly correlated with gender attitudes, suggesting that Twitter is a useful measure of public opinion about gender. However, Twitter sentiment is not fully representative. The gender attitudes of nonwhites and the less educated are unrelated to Twitter sentiment, indicating limits in the extent to which inferences can be drawn from Twitter data.},

	abstract = {Social media technologies like Twitter are credited with enabling a new form of connective action, in which political movements coalesce and mobilise around hashtags, memes and personalised action frames. After the UK riots in 2011, citizen ‘broom armies’ took to the streets to clear up and repair damage. Different hashtags, including \#RiotCleanUp and \#OperationCupOfTea, were implicated in these movements.This paper questions connective action theory in this context. It seeks to respond to two criticisms of the connective approach, namely that connective action underplays differences between technologies and does not account sufficiently for cultural and ideological drivers of action.The paper combines an analysis of software systems, issue publics and discourse to giver a fuller account of connective politics during the riot clean-up movements. In doing so, it develops several metrics to advance understanding of digital communication systems, drawing attention to the roles that time and account status play in assembling meaning on Twitter. This analysis suggests that the clean-up movements were complex, discursive political acts, in which celebrity accounts played an influential role in framing discourse. Furthermore, the \#RiotCleanUp hashtag credited with mobilising these groups is found to provide a less compelling explanation of action when compared against the more emotive but less noted \#OperationCupOfTea.},

In addition, in-depth interviews with key Indonesian journalists, social media activists and media scholars were conducted to examine the issue. The results of this study suggest that diffusion of the movements' messages into the public sphere, along with the politicians' supportive resonance towards the cases, were the main factors influencing the success of these two movements. Importantly, this article argues that while the most important role in this process was played by the vast and positive mainstream media coverage of the cases, social media also played a key role given they initiated the movement discourse and directed it towards mainstream media.},

Refuting arguments that focus on the role of the social media, or divisions among the elite, and the alleged neutrality of the Egyptian military, I argue that a revolutionary coalition of the middle and lower classes created a breaking point for the regime. Key features of this mass mobilization included the refusal of protesters to be cowed by state violence, the creation of "liberated zones" occupied by the people, as well as "popular security" organizations that replaced the repressive security apparatus of the state, and strikes that crippled the economy in the final days of the Mubarak era. My research is based on participant observation in and around Tahrir Square as well as dozens of interviews with Egyptian citizens.},

The results from event history analyses suggest that, after controlling for community characteristics, online activities on Facebook and Twitter are associated with the spread of protests. The association is stronger for Facebook than other Internet-enabled technologies. The importance of Facebook activities increases over time, but the importance of community characteristics such as population size decreases over time. While intermunicipal contagion does not affect the diffusion process directly, it affects the diffusion in combination with online activities: the effect of spatial proximity to prior sites of contention increases in cities where Facebook activities preexist. The results provide a better understanding of how the Internet and social media activity create new communication channels among potential sites of contention and facilitate the rapid diffusion of contentious collective actions across wide areas.},

This paper considers methodological and conceptual challenges for this emergent field, with special attention to the validity and representativeness of social media big data analyses. Persistent issues include the over-emphasis of a single platform, Twitter, sampling biases arising from selection by hashtags, and vague and unrepresentative sampling frames. The socio-cultural complexity of user behavior aimed at algorithmic invisibility (such as subtweeting, mock-retweeting, use of "screen captures" for text, etc.) further complicate interpretation of big data social media. Other challenges include accounting for field effects, i.e. broadly consequential events that do not diffuse only through the network under study but affect the whole society. The application of network methods from other fields to the study of human social activity may not always be appropriate. The paper concludes with a call to action on practical steps to improve our analytic capacity in this promising, rapidly-growing field.},

[again, echoing back the problems of interpreting social media data, including representativeness/sampling, interpretability of what a tweet means (e.g. could be mock-tweeting), reliance on one platform, Twitter]
RQ: What are the methodological pitfalls of social media data?
 
CCs:
1) Biggest problem: social media is so new, and scholars have begun using it. Inference of social media data is difficulty.
2) The problem is that we still have not figured out the system of social media, how to extract data from it rigorously and systematically, and have not fully interpreted what people do within it.
Notes:
Methodological Considerations1) Focusing solely on Twitter leads to non-representativeness of mechanisms and samples. 2) Selection effects: -- selecting based on dependent variable in hashtag analyses -- and hashtags are not necessarily proxies for activity3) Missing denominator  -- lack information on who saw, only on who clicked/liked/shared-- this data is proprietary4) Missing multi-platform consideration of media
Inferences \& Interpretation
1) Interpreting retweet: implicitly seen as positive, but can be negative2) Other undetected behaviors include subtweeting, screen captures, hate-linking3) Limits of importing network models from other fields without assessing "appropriateness"4) Networks do not consider "field" effects, so miss out on multi-scale nature of human interactions5) Gaming social media systems by coordinated ppl, bots, etc.
Prescriptions:
1) Target non-social dependent variables2) Qualitative pull-outs of vast data3) Pseudo-panel studies of people4) Industry outreach5) Convergent answers and complimentary methods (social media should be paired with other methods)6) multi-disciplinary teams7) methodological awareness in review process, article},

Specifically, our results suggest that respondents do not engage in communicative action typical of the public sphere because they avoid political discourse online. Three factors influence this: (1) fear of online harassment and workplace surveillance; (2) engagement only with politically similar others; and (3) characterization of social media as a place for “happy” interactions. In addition, we find that these three factors interrelate, often sequentially, and we explore similarities and minor differences between Millennials and Generation Xers regarding each factor.},

Argument: To gain more media coverage of social movements, SMOs must be organized, professional and strategically planned, and division of labor among movement actors. Audience size, visual/entertainment value influence movements
SM characteristics -{\textgreater} media coverage: movement standing, preferred framing, and sympathy
Media coverage -{\textgreater} SM outcomes: leadership, action strategy, and framing strategy
Data:
Findings
-presents numerous hypotheses that forward importance of organization, professionalization, strategic planning, division of labor, to garner media attention
HYP: 
1) Greater Resources, organization, professionalism -{\textgreater} greater media standing and preferred frame
2) Greater division of labor -{\textgreater} greater ability to gain standing and preferred frames
3) Narrower demands -{\textgreater} receive more sympathetic portrayals
4) larger and more elite audience, greater impact on movement framing
5) more media emphasizes entertainment and spectacle, more influence on leader choices on strategy and actions
6) more media emphasize visual, movements more like to produce action strategies that emphasize spectacle, drama, and confrontation 
Theory/Lit Review:
Two complex parties interacting with one another (conflicts, transactional)
1) DEPENDENCY: Media greater power over movement - movements need media for mobilization, validation, and scope enlargement (116); media need movements to put drama, conflict, etc. on the news story; dependency leads to consequences where the movement needs to pay a price of entry, as such movements have to enter into resource mobilization 
2) FRAMING: Negotiation over meaning - movements and media create meaning out of events (frame them); struggle over framing; media/journalists act as gatekeepers; role of movements is to take mainstream/uncontested ideas and employ contested interpretations of events (117); movements have to communicate interpretations through mainstream languages
Dimensions: Structural (power and dependency) and Cultural (contest over meaning)
Presents Three AREAS of media coverage interest of movements: 1) standing, 2) preferred framing, 3) movement sympathy (121)},

It is difficult to find anyone who would claim that media discourse in the United States even remotely approaches this ideal. The overwhelming conclusion is that the media generally operate in ways that promote apathy, cynicism, and quiescence, rather than active citizenship and participation. Furthermore, all the trends seem to be in the wrong direction--toward more and more messages, from fewer and bigger producers, saying less and less. That's the bad news. The good news is that the messages provide a many-voiced, open text that can and often is read oppositionally, at least in part. Television imagery is a site of struggle where the powers that be are often forced to compete and defend what they would prefer to have taken for granted. The underdetermined nature of media discourse allows plenty of room for challengers such as social movements to offer competing constructions of reality and to find support for them from readers whose daily lives may lead them to construct meaning in ways that go beyond media imagery.},

In response to \#BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted \#AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. In particular, we introduce methodology that not only quantifies these divergences, but also reveals whether they are from widespread discussion or a few popular retweets within these groups. We find that \#BlackLivesMatter exhibits many informationally rich conversations, while those within \#AllLivesMatter are more muted and susceptible to hijacking. We also show that the discussion within \#BlackLivesMatter is more likely to center around the deaths of Black Americans, while that of \#AllLivesMatter is more likely to sympathize with the lives of police officers and express politically conservative views.},

	abstract = {In 2014, a dedicated activist movement — Black Lives Matter (BLM) — ignited an urgent national conversation about police killings of unarmed Black citizens. Online tools have been anecdotally credited as critical in this effort, but researchers are only beginning to evaluate this claim. This research report examines the movement’s uses of online media in 2014 and 2015. To do so, we analyze three types of data: 40.8 million tweets, over 100,000 web links, and 40 interviews of BLM activists and allies. Most of the report is devoted to detailing our findings, which include: *Although the \#Blacklivesmatter hashtag was created in July 2013, it was rarely used through the summer of 2014 and did not come to signify a movement until the months after the Ferguson protests.*Social media posts by activists were essential in spreading Michael Brown’s story nationally.* Protesters and their supporters were generally able to circulate their own narratives on Twitter without relying on mainstream news outlets.* There are six major communities that consistently discussed police brutality on Twitter in 2014 and 2015: Black Lives Matter, Anonymous/Bipartisan Report, Black Entertainers, Conservatives, Mainstream News, and Young Black Twitter.* The vast majority of the communities we observed supported justice for the victims and decisively denounced police brutality.* Black youth discussed police brutality frequently on Twitter, but in ways that differed substantially from how activists discussed it.* Evidence that activists succeeded in educating casual observers on Twitter came in two main forms: expressions of awe and disbelief at the violent police reactions to the Ferguson protests, and conservative admissions of police brutality in the Eric Garner and Walter Scott cases.* The primary goals of social media use among our interviewees were education, amplification of marginalized voices, and structural police reform.In our concluding section, we reflect on the practical importance and implications of our findings. We hope this report contributes to the specific conversation about how Black Lives Matter and related movements have used online tools as well as to broader conversations about the general capacity of such tools to facilitate social and political change.},

-Documenting black lives matter movement on social media; description of what happened, and dynamics within social media postings as events persist
Sections:
BLM Website Network: a news network, and
Twitter: episodic coverage; massive spikes in some periods and long lulls afterwards--large majority are also retweets while few posts are unique (heavily right skewed distribution)    1) Communities and Participants -- identify and label ten largest communities/hubs of twitter users, with six recurring communities: BLM hubs and activists, Anonymous/Bipartisan reporting (left hactivist communities), black entertainers/celebrities, conservatives, mainstream news, and young black twitter (problems associated with this type of categorization)    2) Tweets are generally supportive, opposition, and non-aligned (and a bit discussion of frames)    3) most shared images
\#Black Lives Matter: little in the beginning (mostly by activists), but mostly generated later during non-indictment
Participant Interviews: education and amplifying activist messages
Nine Periods, each with different hashtags being used and networks using them: interesting topics -{\textgreater} worthiness of tweets between Eric Garner v.s. Michael Brown, esp. by conservatives; during periods of decline, movement orgs/activists continue movement (e.g. P7)
Mostly black-led throughout the periods, supportives shared more widely than otherwise--mostly about men
some qualitative data:"We can see, for example, that neither video evidence, not photographic evidence, nor being killed with a gun, nor mass protests, nor the victim’s age is consistently  associated with conversation volume on Twitter. Generally, incidents with some form of evidence seem to attract more attention than those without, but the mere presence of video or images is not sufficient to interest non-activists." (76)
-phenomemon of black humor around police brutality, distinction between BLM activists and Young Black Twitter posts memorialization
Digital Tools and consequences: 1) as tools to generate counter-narratives and able to spread messages online, 2) important as imagery in social media (issue of police brutality), 3) power of audience and others to shape what gets tweeted, that BLM does not include creators that much and is geared mostly for black men killed by police
Data:
Tweets on BLM and other searchings, website hyperlink connections between BLM-related websites, and interviews of anti-police brutality activists and allies

In the process, we demonstrate a methodological innovation designed to capture social effects by exogenously inducing network behavior. In both experiments, we find that direct, private messages to followers of a nonprofit advocacy organization’s Twitter account are highly effective at increasing support for an online petition. Surprisingly, public tweets have no effect at all. We additionally randomize the private messages to prime subjects with either a “follower” or an “organizer” identity but find no evidence that this affects the likelihood of signing the petition. Finally, in the second experiment, followers of subjects induced to tweet a link to the petition are more likely to sign it—evidence of a campaign gone “viral.” In presenting these results, we contribute to a nascent body of experimental literature exploring political behavior in online social media.},

Brown's body lay in the street for four and a half hours, and during that time, his neighbors and friends took to social media to express fear, confusion, and outrage. We locate early tweets about Ferguson and the use of the hashtag \#Ferguson at the center of a counterpublic network that provoked and shaped public debates about race, policing, governance, and justice. Extending theory on networked publics, we examine how everyday citizens, followed by activists and journalists, influenced the \#Ferguson Twitter network with a focus on emergent counterpublic structure and discursive strategy. We stress the importance of combining quantitative and qualitative methods to identify early initiators of online dissent and story framing. We argue that initiators and their discursive contributions are often missed by methods that collapse longitudinal network data into a single snapshot rather than investigating the dynamic emergence of crowdsourced elites over time.},

However, Black Twitter as an entity has not been theoretically contextualized and grounded in empirical research. In this research, the authors situate Black Twitter within the public sphere–counterpublic literature and ask the question: can Black Twitter be understood as a counterpublic? The authors compare Black Twitter, as indicated by the \#BlackTwitter hashtag, with hashtags indicating the public sphere—\#TCOT (Top Conservatives on Twitter) for conservatives and \#UniteBlue for progressives—and with a hashtag indicating another potential counterpublic—\#BCOT (Black Conservatives on Twitter). Using a corpus of 16,000 tweets collected during a 10-day period, comparisons were made in interaction patterns (tweets, favorites, and replies) and thematic content.

We find that the posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and status updates. We also find that posts that use confrontational messages and messages about solidarity appear most often in the top posts.

	abstract = {Twitter provides a useful tool for studying public conversations about climate change, an issue that crosses international boundaries and stirs political and scientific debate. This review presents what is currently known about the way climate change is discussed on Twitter, acknowledging advantages and limitations and suggesting future areas for study. As an accessible platform, Twitter allows public expression of opinions on climate change and provides data on how these fluctuate over different times and places. Moving forward, studies assessing climate views can be improved by better linking them to demographic and other data indicating the population that Twitter users represent. The open-ended content of tweets provides additional information, such as which topics are associated with climate change and which terms are used to discuss it. Future studies can build on these results to capture a wider range of climate-related discussion. Finally, researchers are using Twitter to understand who initiates and participates in climate change dialog and how, by categorizing users as different actors—such as politicians, celebrities, NGOs, or the general public. Future research could consider how effective these efforts are, and how Twitter activity translates to offline outcomes.},

	abstract = {From the Arab Spring to the Occupy Movement, social media has been instrumental in driving and supporting socio-political movements throughout the world. In this paper, we present one of the first social media investigations of an activist movement around racial discrimination and police violence, known as “Black Lives Matter”. Considering Twitter as a sensor for the broader community’s perception of the events related to the movement, we study participation over time, the geographical differences in this participation, and its relationship to protests that unfolded on the ground. We find evidence for continued participation across four temporally separated events related to the movement, with notable changes in engagement and language over time. We also find that participants from regions of historically high rates of black victimization due to police violence tend to express greater negativity and make more references to loss of life. Finally, we observe that social media attributes of affect, behavior and language can predict future protest participation on the ground. We discuss the role of social media in enabling collective action around this unique movement and how social media platforms may help understand perceptions on a socially contested and sensitive issue like race.},

]
-this work looks at implications of online communications on offline protests in BLM movement
Notes:
RQs:
RQ 1: What are the temporal characteristics of social media participation in the BLM movement?
RQ 2: How do engagement and linguistic attributes of this participation manifest geographically, specifically in regions of high historical police violence against blacks?
RQ 3: In what ways do these social media attributes of engagement and language around BLM relate to protests that unfolded on the ground?
Data and Methods:
-social media data (tweets): four phases -- major hashtag and add in others that seem relevant
Our first dataset (Ferguson I) spans between Aug 8 and Aug 27, 2014; Our second dataset (Ferguson II) contains posts between Nov 11 and Dec 10, 2014, and was also obtained using \#ferguson as the filtering hashtag.; Our third dataset (NYC) included posts made between Dec 19, 2014 and Jan 19, 2015 around two counter protests that arose following the incidents in Ferguson.; Finally, our last dataset (Baltimore) between Apr 12 and May 6, 2015 consisted of posts shared on Twitter during the demonstrations that followed the death of Freddie Gray while in police custody for allegedly possessing an illegal switchblade.-- infer location data using user reported location string
-police shooting data: Fatal encounters, and rate of blacks killed per state using Census
-protest data: elephrame and other datasets; (protest volume = \# of individuals involved in BLM protests each day in US)
-social media activity: number of posts shared, number of unique users, number of retweets, number of @-reply posts, and number of link-bearing posts.
-LIWC content of post--positive affect (PA), and negative affect (NA), and four other measures of emotional expression: anger, anxiety, sadness, and swear.
Results:
RQ 1: Evolution of Participation
-finding that large percent (30\%ish) of new users continue onwards from new BLM event to next BLM event
-suggestive finding that users move from singular/individual to collective/third person references in sentiment analysis
RQ 2: Contrasting Geographical Patterns
-
RQ 3: Predictors of Protest Volume
-Twitter activity/expression -{\textgreater} predicts protests/demonstrations

In this article, I draw from literature on social networks, online mobilization, and women's movements to examine the role of online feminist social networks in feminist mobilization. Presenting qualitative data from a racially and geographically heterogeneous group of college feminists, I argue that Facebook and feminist blogs enlarge and nourish feminist networks, create online feminist communities, expand recruitment bases for online and offline mobilization, and increase opportunities for online interaction with adversaries. Finally, I consider generational shifts in the feminist movement, and the broader relationship between friendship networks and online and offline mobilization.},

This paper contributes to a growing body of sociological literature on social media by applying an intersectional framework to a content analysis of over 400,000 tweets related to \#SayHerName. Our findings demonstrate that Twitter users who identified with \#SayHerName engage in intersectional mobilization by highlighting Black women victims of police violence and giving attention to intersections with gender identity. \#SayHerName is a dialogue that centres Black cisgender and transgender women victims of state-sanctioned violence. Additionally, \#SayHerName is a space for highlighting Black women victims of non-police violence. Therefore, we propose that future research on social media activism should incorporate intersectionality as a basis for understanding the symbols and language of twenty-first century social movements.},

This manuscript presents the results of a meta-analysis of research on social media use and participation. Overall, the metadata demonstrate a positive relationship between social media use and participation. More than 80\% of coefficients are positive. However, questions remain about whether the relationship is causal and transformative. Only half of the coefficients were statistically significant. Studies using panel data are less likely to report positive and statistically significant coefficients between social media use and participation, compared to cross-sectional surveys.

We show how engaging in “hashtag activism” can forge a shared political temporality, and, additionally, we examine how social media platforms can provide strategic outlets for contesting and reimagining the materiality of racialized bodies.

A refinement of Howard's network ethnography approach serves as a mixed methods design strategy. A network analysis of hyperlinks revealed the structure of the network, while member interviews were used to discuss the importance of such connections. The findings revealed the importance of ICTs in maintaining a movement through the creation of an unintentional networked community in times of both mobilization and latency. Notably, the resultant network has allowed the campus living wage movement to overcome previous limitations inherit in student protest, and sustained the campus struggle through several student generations.},

	abstract = {Social media have provided instrumental means of communication in many recent political protests. The efficiency of online networks in disseminating timely information has been praised by many commentators; at the same time, users are often derided as “slacktivists” because of the shallow commitment involved in clicking a forwarding button. Here we consider the role of these peripheral online participants, the immense majority of users who surround the small epicenter of protests, representing layers of diminishing online activity around the committed minority. We analyze three datasets tracking protest communication in different languages and political contexts through the social media platform Twitter and employ a network decomposition technique to examine their hierarchical structure. We provide consistent evidence that peripheral participants are critical in increasing the reach of protest messages and generating online content at levels that are comparable to core participants. Although committed minorities may constitute the heart of protest movements, our results suggest that their success in maximizing the number of online citizens exposed to protest messages depends, at least in part, on activating the critical periphery. Peripheral users are less active on a per capita basis, but their power lies in their numbers: their aggregate contribution to the spread of protest messages is comparable in magnitude to that of core participants. An analysis of two other datasets unrelated to mass protests strengthens our interpretation that core-periphery dynamics are characteristically important in the context of collective action events. Theoretical models of diffusion in social networks would benefit from increased attention to the role of peripheral nodes in the propagation of information and behavior.},

	abstract = {Social media sites are rapidly becoming one of the most important forums for public deliberation about advocacy issues. However, social scientists have not explained why some advocacy organizations produce social media messages that inspire far-ranging conversation among social media users, whereas the vast majority of them receive little or no attention. I argue that advocacy organizations are more likely to inspire comments from new social media audiences if they create “cultural bridges,” or produce messages that combine conversational themes within an advocacy field that are seldom discussed together. I use natural language processing, network analysis, and a social media application to analyze how cultural bridges shaped public discourse about autism spectrum disorders on Facebook over the course of 1.5 years, controlling for various characteristics of advocacy organizations, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. I show that organizations that create substantial cultural bridges provoke 2.52 times more comments about their messages from new social media users than those that do not, controlling for these factors. This study thus offers a theory of cultural messaging and public deliberation and computational techniques for text analysis and application-based survey research.},

	abstract = {The wave of sit-ins that swept through the American South in the spring of 1960 transformed the struggle for racial equality. This episode is widely cited in the literature on social movements, but the debate over its explanation remains unresolved-partly because previous research has relied on case studies of a few large cities. The authors use event-history analysis to trace the diffusion of sit-ins throughout the South and to compare cities where sit-ins occurred with the majority of cities where they did not. They assess the relative importance of three channels of diffusion: movement organizations, social networks, and news media. The authors find that movement organizations played an important role in orchestrating protest; what mattered was a cadre of activists rather than mass membership. There is little evidence that social networks acted as a channel for diffusion among cities. By contrast, news media were crucial for conveying information about protests elsewhere. In addition, the authors demonstrate that sit-ins were most likely to occur where there were many college students, where adults in the black community had greater resources and autonomy, and where political opportunities were more favorable.},

In many of these mobilizations, communication operates as an organizational process that may replace or supplement familiar forms of collective action based on organizational resource mobilization, leadership, and collective action framing. In some cases, connective action emerges from crowds that shun leaders, as when Occupy protesters created media networks to channel resources and create loose ties among dispersed physical groups. In other cases, conventional political organizations deploy personalized communication logics to enable large-scale engagement with a variety of political causes. The Logic of Connective Action shows how power is organized in communication-based networks, and what political outcomes may result.},

After mining 20 M tweets related to nearly 200 instances of political protest from 2009 to 2013, we identified a network of individuals tweeting across geographically distant protest hashtags and revisited the term “serial activists.” We contacted 191 individuals and conducted 21 in-depth, semi-structured interviews thematically coded to provide a typology of serial activists and their struggles with institutionalized power. We found that these users have an ordinary following, but bridge disparate language communities and facilitate collective action by virtue of their dedication to multiple causes. Serial activists differ from influentials or traditional grassroots activists and their activity challenges Twitter scholarship foregrounding the two-step flow model of communication. The results add a much needed depth to the prevalent data-driven treatment of political Twitter by describing a class of extraordinarily prolific users beyond influentials and the twittertariat.},

We argue that rational and emotional styles of communication ebb and flow within public discussions about social problems due to the alternating influence of social contagion and saturation effects. These “cognitive-emotional currents” create an opportunity structure whereby advocacy organizations stimulate more conversation if they produce emotional messages after prolonged rational debate or vice versa. We test this hypothesis using automated text-analysis techniques that measure the frequency of cognitive and emotional language within two advocacy fields on Facebook over 1.5 years, and a web-based application that offered these organizations a complimentary audit of their social media outreach in return for sharing nonpublic data about themselves, their social media audiences, and the broader social context in which they interact. Time-series models reveal strong support for our hypothesis, controlling for 33 confounding factors measured by our Facebook application. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for future research on public deliberation, how social contagions relate to each other, and the emerging field of computational social science.},

Yet these new data sources lack critical information about the broader social context of collective behavior—or protect it behind strict privacy barriers. In this article, I introduce social media survey apps (SMSAs) that adjoin computational social science methods with conventional survey techniques in order to enable more comprehensive analysis of collective behavior online. SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.},

	abstract = {The shooting death of Michael Brown by a police officer in August 2014 served as a pivotal case that pushed excessive use of police force against minority groups to the national spotlight. Guided by the scholarship on protest coverage, this article investigates the interplay between advocacy and journalistic framing in the coverage of the Ferguson protests by national and local news. A content analysis of five newspapers during the first cycle of protests identified how journalistic frames of presentation derived from the ?protest paradigm? literature related to the content frames pushed forward by the Black Lives Matter movement. Results reveal that initial stories were predominantly episodic and focused on violence to the detriment of demands and grievances. However, episodic stories were also critical of the police response and the use of military-grade weapons to contain the demonstrations. As the weeks progressed, journalists gave space to the ideas of protestors in a more thematic way, especially on issues related to race beyond the topic of police brutality. Taken together, findings suggest small but significant progress as time continued during the first month of demonstrations after Brown?s shooting. Results presented here challenge the paradigmatic nature of protest coverage but reinforce that more space should be given to contextual narratives behind social movements? actions in addition to coverage that is critical of police and protestor tactics.},

	abstract = {Scholars have long studied how social movements frame and deliver their messages, yet less is known about how these “signals” are received by the public. In this study, we examine how a social movement participant’s characteristics interact with a bystander’s to influence movement support. In addition, we examine how perceived likelihood of violence mediates these outcomes. We propose five competing models based on previous theories of emotion, race, and political views in social movement support. To adjudicate between these frameworks, we conduct an experiment using a 2x2 factorial design in which participants read a news story about a protest accompanied by an image of a neutral/angry, white/Black protestor, measuring three types of social movement support, and examine results and model fit. Results provide support for a politicized-race model: a Black protestor is more motivating for liberals’ social movement support, while a white protestor is more motivating for conservatives. Both liberals and conservatives are more likely to associate the protest with violence after seeing a Black protestor compared to a white one. Racialized perceptions of violence explain part of conservatives’ hesitancy to support the movement when seeing a Black protestor and inhibits part of the otherwise-positive effect of seeing a Black protestor for liberals.},

Four features were systematically manipulated: protesters’ worthiness, unity, numbers, and commitment (WUNC). The experiments scrutinize the extent to which journalists consider a protest newsworthy (presence) and the likelihood that a protest is featured on a newspaper’s front page (prominence) . Our results show that in terms of media presence, high turnout is key. Highly unified protesters, in contrast, are considered less newsworthy. Regarding prominence, strongly committed demonstrators more easily make it to the frontpage. Individual characteristics of journalists have no direct effect on news judgment. Journalists’ editorial status and ideological (outlet) placement only moderate the effect of some of the protest features, although in terms of front-page placement a more potent adversary versus ally effect is distinguished.},

	abstract = {As protests erupted across the United States in recent years over racialized issues (e.g., Black Lives Matter and Confederate monuments), so too did questions about when and how police should respond. Understanding public attitudes toward protest policing is important for police legitimacy and policy. One theory is that citizens are willing to trade civil liberties, such as the right to assemble, for security, and thus disruptive or dangerous protest tactics should increase support for police control by elevating public fear. Another theory is that citizens view protests through the lens of group position, and thus, they should be more supportive of repression when protest goals conflict with preexisting racial beliefs and threaten racial interests. To test these theories, we embedded an experiment in a nationwide survey fielded in 2020 after George Floyd's killing sparked the broadest protests in U.S. history. We randomized protest tactics (e.g., weapon carrying) and goals, as well as other contextual characteristics (e.g., protest size). We found that the public generally opposed repressive protest policing. Certain protest tactics, however, increased support for repression by elevating fear. Protest goals (e.g., pro-Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrants) also impacted support for repression, but the effect depended on respondents’ racial beliefs.},

	abstract = {Social movements are critical agents of social change, but are rarely monolithic. Instead, movements are often made up of distinct factions with unique agendas and tactics, and there is little scientific consensus on when these factions may complement—or impede—one another’s influence. One central debate concerns whether radical flanks within a movement increase support for more moderate factions within the same movement by making the moderate faction seem more reasonable—or reduce support for moderate factions by making the entire movement seem unreasonable. Results of two online experiments conducted with diverse samples (N = 2,772), including a study of the animal rights movement and a preregistered study of the climate movement, show that the presence of a radical flank increases support for a moderate faction within the same movement. Further, it is the use of radical tactics, such as property destruction or violence, rather than a radical agenda, that drives this effect. Results indicate the effect owes to a contrast effect: Use of radical tactics by one flank led the more moderate faction to appear less radical, even though all characteristics of the moderate faction were held constant. This perception led participants to identify more with and, in turn, express greater support for the more moderate faction. These results suggest that activist groups that employ unpopular tactics can increase support for other groups within the same movement, pointing to a hidden way in which movement factions are complementary, despite pursuing divergent approaches to social change.},

	abstract = {How do protest actions impact public support for social movements? Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions—protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both—typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement’s central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4–6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers’ emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.

We expected that the presence (vs. absence) of advantaged group members at a protest will increase politicized identification among advantaged group observers, which was confirmed in Studies 1A–1C. In contrast, we expected that the disadvantaged group observers will increase or decrease their politicized identification depending on the role advantaged group members have at a protest (i.e., supportive vs. leadership role). Studies 2A–2B revealed that when advantaged group members had a supportive role, disadvantaged and advantaged group observers increased their politicized identification, but this effect was absent when they had a leadership role. Moreover, including advantaged group members in a protest increased the belief that solidarity is a normative behavior and the expectations that a protest will be peaceful among observers.

This study first identifies and then codes the main frames in all reports about domestic protest in the United Kingdom. Analysing data that covers eight national newspapers during a 26 year period (N = 27,496), I provide a more systematic understanding of how the mainstream news media in liberal democracies report about protests. The analysis shows that a stable majority of articles uses frames linked to the protest paradigm throughout the time period. However, a substantial and growing number of articles employ legitimizing frames—either on their own or co-existing with delegitimizing framing.},

We find that sit-in protest greatly increased the probability of desegregation, as did protest in nearby cities. Over time, desegregation in one city raised the probability of desegregation nearby.

I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.},

In addition to the frames found in past research, we identify a prominent Politics frame, often focussing on the role of Trump in inciting and reacting to racial tensions. An in-depth analysis of the application of frames to each protest revealed a nuanced use of the Protest Paradigm. We suggest possible revisions to existing theories, and discuss the potential social and political implications of our findings.},

	abstract = {This study tests the robustness of the “protest paradigm”—a routinized, predominantly negative pattern in covering social protest—by examining the news coverage of the 2021 US Capitol attack in eight countries that vary in the nature of their political regime and geopolitical standing, with democratic US allies United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, France, Australia on one side, and authoritarian adversaries Russia, China, and Iran on the other. Based on a computer-assisted analysis of 3,579 news articles, the study shows that rather than operating as a rigid template, the protest paradigm offers national media a malleable set of journalistic devices that can be appropriated to construct the meaning of disruptive global events in a way that reproduces dominant domestic ideologies and advances the ruling elites’ geopolitical interests. In addition to theoretical contribution, the study offers a novel empirical finding to the literature on protest coverage by providing evidence of national media not simply deviating from, but explicitly violating the protest paradigm. As demonstrated by the analysis of the Russian press, rather than delegitimizing the January 6 attackers by making light of their agenda and emphasizing their unruly behavior—which could be expected from coverage consistent with the protest paradigm—the Russian state-owned media trivialized the brutality of the attack by opting for cues with less violent connotations and elevated the legitimacy of the protesters’ actions by framing them as valid demands by politically minded citizens unjustly prosecuted for concerns about the integrity of electoral process.},

	abstract = {How do people respond to violent political protest? The authors present a theory proposing that the use of violence leads the general public to view a protest group as less reasonable, a perception that reduces identification with the group. This reduced identification in turn reduces public support for the violent group. Furthermore, the authors argue that violence also leads to more support for groups that are perceived as opposing the violent group. The authors test this theory using a large (n = 800) Internet-based survey experiment with a politically diverse sample. Participants responded to an experimental scenario based on recent violent confrontations between white nationalist protesters and antiracist counter-protesters, allowing the authors to study whether violent protest would reduce public support even when used against a widely reviled group. The authors found that the use of violence by an antiracist group against white nationalists led to decreased support for the antiracist group and increased support for the white nationalist group. Furthermore, the results were consistent with the theorized causal process: violence led to perceptions of unreasonableness, which reduced identification with and support for the protest group. Importantly, the results revealed a striking asymmetry: although acts of violence eroded support for an antiracist group, support for white nationalist groups was not reduced by the use of violence, perhaps because the public already perceives these groups as very unreasonable and identifies with them at low levels. Consistent with this interpretation, the authors found that self-identified Republicans, a subset of the sample that reported less extremely negative views of white nationalists, showed reduced support for white nationalists when they engaged in violence.},

To what extent might media use moderate the role of public opinion in predicting political participation in the digital age? This study investigates these questions by analysing unique data from an experiment and a representative survey designed and conducted at the height of the summer 2011 protests in Israel. This study offers a new analytical model for studying activism by independently and simultaneously examining the direct and indirect effects of perceptions of majority support, individual support and media use on political behaviour. The experimental results suggest that perceptions of public opinion and media use did affect participation in the 2011 social movement. Specifically, increased perception of majority support for the movement led to increased rates of participation. Moreover, media use was inconsequential among those respondents who perceived that a majority of the public supported the protest. Digital media had a moderate effect on the association between perceptions and support for the protest movement, but there was no such effect with respect to mainstream media use. The findings provide new empirical insight into the effects of perceptions of public opinion and media use on political behaviour. In doing so, they help to explain the development of mass protest movements in the digital age and especially the potential effect of perceptions and media use in promoting the evolution of social movements as well as involvement in collective action in the digital age.},

We conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the least disruptive.

This study argues that activists’ motives are for an important part shaped by mass media coverage on the protest issue. It investigates the link between people's reasons to protest, the campaign messages of the protest organizers, and newspaper coverage prior to the demonstration. Data cover 14 anti-austerity demonstrations in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Results show that social movements depend a lot on other political actors to gain media visibility for their messages. Furthermore, the relationship between social movement frames and protest participant motives is mediated by newspaper coverage. Protest organizers’ are able to reach demonstrators via their own communication channels to some extent, but for many of their messages, they also rely on journalists’ reporting about the protest issue.},

Media-independent data on protest events (police archives from Brussels) are combined with a content analysis of the resulting news reports (Belgian Television; N = 564) to test hypotheses drawn from journalism and protest impact literature. Results show that protester voices dominate protest reports and that reactions of targets are more prominent and negative than those of third parties. Demonstrations which are large, reactive, and which have a domestic and political target that is specifically addressed, are more likely to include target reactions. Disruptive demonstrations trigger negative third-party reactions, whereas large demonstrations trigger positive third-party reactions.

Elected officials were exposed to manipulated television news items covering a protest demonstration. Following Tilly?s previously untested WUNC claim, four features of the event were manipulated: the demonstrators? worthiness, unity, numerical strength, and commitment. We argue that these protest features present elected officials with useful cues about what (a segment of) the public wants. We find that these cues affect elected officials? beliefs. The salience they attach to the protest issue, the position they take, and their intended actions all change as a consequence of exposure. The size of a protest event (numbers) and whether the protesters agree among themselves (unity) are the most persuasive protest factors. The effects of the protest signals come on top of strong receiver effects. We find no evidence that elected officials? predispositions moderate the effects of the protest features.},

While groups organize and demonstrate in a peaceful manner, there is no guarantee that onlookers will perceive them as such. We find it necessary to explore what factors shape perceptions of social movement protests and how the racial composition of a demonstration can elicit dramatically different responses from onlookers. Methods: To examine the impact of racial identity on protest evaluations, we conduct a survey experiment on a total of 921 respondents. We simulate a media report concerning a Black Lives Matter protest to determine how subtle changes in the racial composition of the demonstration elicit varying perceptions of a potential for violence. Results: We find that protests that comprise all-Black participants are perceived to have a higher probability to end in violence than more diverse demonstrations. These findings come despite an assurance that the protest in question was peaceful. Consistent with minority threat theory, these perceptions are largely driven by the sentiments of white respondents. Conclusion: We argue that ill-conceived threat perceptions, rooted in the racial composition of Black Lives Matter protests, complicate the mission of those charged with making visible the plight of Black Americans. Even when Black protesters adhere to the “rules” of non-violent protest, there is no guarantee that the biases of onlookers will not drown out their efforts. These findings have wide reaching implications on the exercise of First Amendment right to protest, the role of the media in reporting on protests, and the expectations of government interactions with protesters.},

We argue that the dominant frames speakers used to explain police actions during the social uprising justified police violence as a legitimate response to a criminal threat and as consistent with police protocols and the law. While reasserting police legitimacy, the frames delegitimise claims of human rights abuses (often explicitly) and shift the dominant public conversation away from discussions of broader public security and public order reforms that could better reduce police violence. Such frames reveal the tensions between police legitimacy and human rights protections, and the power of state and civil society voices elevated in the media to challenge the latter.},

Using data from a nationally representative election survey, it examines the association between news consumption and support for law-and-order policies to address protest violence, with perceptions that the protesters were violent as a potential mediator. Findings indicate that viewers of online news are less likely to support law-and-order policies. This relationship is mediated by perceived protester violence, with perceived violence enhancing support for law-and-order policies. Further examination shows that political bias plays a role: viewers of left-leaning sites are less likely to support law-and-order policies to address protest violence, while viewers of right-leaning sites are more likely. These relationships are also mediated by perceived violence. Policy Implications A slight majority of respondents indicate that they lean toward solving problems of racism and police violence, indicating that much of the American public is open to criminal justice reform. Perceived violence helps to shape the association of online news media with support for law-and-order policies. Activists should avoid violence in their protests and use Internet-based media sources to publicize their peaceful activities and demands. Law enforcement agencies should use the Internet and social media to keep the public informed of the reality of protests, especially of any violence that occurs, in an effort to justify forceful tactics.},

This study investigated the narratives produced in news coverage of Black Lives Matter protests and how media consumption and individual predispositions help us understand public support for the movement. Combining a content analysis of news about protests and a survey of people’s attitudes, we assessed if patterns in mainstream and partisan coverage have changed, and how those patterns relate to people’s level of support for the movement, assessment of its effectiveness, and of police response during demonstrations. Our findings suggest that persistent negative patterns of protest coverage continued to dominate news headlines, with a major emphasis on negative actions, disruption, and violence in centerist- and right-leaning media coverage from the Associated Press, CNN and Fox News. MSNBC produced the least coverage overall, but their coverage was most legitimizing. Survey results showed that preexisting attitudes remain consistently stronger determinants of support for the movement than media coverage and suggested a possible ideological asymmetry among the general public. Conservative affiliation and news consumption are strong predictors of less support for Black Lives Matter and perceptions of police response to these protests as too lenient. Mainstream news consumption, though producing predominantly delegitimizing coverage, is correlated with more support for Black Lives Matter.},

Guided by the scholarship on protest coverage, this article investigates the interplay between advocacy and journalistic framing in the coverage of the Ferguson protests by national and local news. A content analysis of five newspapers during the first cycle of protests identified how journalistic frames of presentation derived from the ?protest paradigm? literature related to the content frames pushed forward by the Black Lives Matter movement. Results reveal that initial stories were predominantly episodic and focused on violence to the detriment of demands and grievances. However, episodic stories were also critical of the police response and the use of military-grade weapons to contain the demonstrations. As the weeks progressed, journalists gave space to the ideas of protestors in a more thematic way, especially on issues related to race beyond the topic of police brutality. Taken together, findings suggest small but significant progress as time continued during the first month of demonstrations after Brown?s shooting. Results presented here challenge the paradigmatic nature of protest coverage but reinforce that more space should be given to contextual narratives behind social movements? actions in addition to coverage that is critical of police and protestor tactics.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on the relationship between the mainstream press and right-wing protests in Brazil. Guided by the “protest paradigm” literature, my goal was to understand how reporters in the Global South cover conservative demonstrations. Protest paradigm scholarship found that news norms and routines lead to delegitimizing patterns of coverage, focusing on official viewpoints, spectacle, and violence. Here, I consider how the same practices can aid in the legitimization of right-wing movements. Through a mixed methodology combining content analysis and interviews with reporters from the analyzed outlets, findings revealed that when protesters’ grievances and demands aligned with the preferences of anti-leftist elites, right-wing politicians subsidized information to journalists. The lack of clashes with the police and cohesive leadership also allowed for coverage to become more thematic. As a result, I argue three conditions lead to news legitimization of protests. First, the movement fitting within a broader political conflict between elites. Second, the movement being sympathetic to the state's repressive apparatus. Third, the movement having cohesive leadership and unified identity. These conditions, which favor right-wing demands, drove legitimizing coverage even when reporters viewed the movement with skepticism.},

Using a 3 × 2 experimental design, we explored how frames and visuals affect audiences’ criticism of police and protesters, support for, and identification with the movement. Findings showed that articles with a legitimizing debate frame increased support for protesters, identification with protesters, and police criticism compared to articles with riot and confrontation frames. Riot and confrontation frames increase criticism toward protesters, decreased support for and identification with the movement, and decrease police criticism. We also considered predispositions toward Black people, the police, and social movements in general as essential to understanding support. Results revealed prior levels of support for the movement influenced criticism of police action and support for and identification with protestors more than media frames. As such, we argue that preexisting attitudes about actors in a news story are essential variables to consider in protest coverage effects research.},

	abstract = {Demonstration turnout is a crucial political resource for social movements. In this article, we investigate how mass media cover demonstration size. We develop a typology of turnout coverage and scrutinize the factors that drive turnout coverage. In addition, we test whether media coverage underestimates, reflects, or exaggerates ?guesstimates? by organizers and police forces. Together, these analyses shed light on whether turnout coverage fits a logic of normalization or marginalization. We rely on a unique dataset of 428 demonstrations organized in Brussels (2003?2010). For these demonstrations, we have information on the turnout as reported in national television news, as counted by the police, and as expected by the organizers. We find that media present turnout most often as a fact, rarely as contentious (10 percent). Although few demonstrations pass the media gates, our study yields little to no evidence for a logic of turnout marginalization. Media coverage does not systematically underestimate demonstration size, nor does it blindly follow police counts. Rather, turnout coverage attests of a logic of normalization, following standard news-making practices. The more important the demonstration (size, lead item) and the larger the gap between police and organizer guesstimates, the more attention is paid to turnout in the news. Discussion centers on the generalizability and normative interpretation of the results.},

Unlike political movements of the recent past, the Tea Party stands starkly to the right. This study examines nightly cable news coverage of this movement by using key frames associated with the ?protest paradigm??the tendency for media to marginalize movements by drawing attention away from core concerns raised by such movements. We ask whether the protest paradigm can be applied to a right-wing movement and whether such application varies by the ideological leaning of a given source. That is, do cable news channels use frames in ways consistent with their respective ideological hues? We draw on a representative sample of stories regarding the national movement from the most viewed nightly news programs on Fox News, MSNBC, and CNN, with the Associated Press as a reference point. Results show significant differences across sources in issue and marginalization frame use. Although utilization of marginalization frames is popular among ideological channels, traditional news sources are not immune from using these devices.},

	abstract = {A new view of twentieth-century US social movements, Rough Draft of History examines how national newspapers covered social movements and the organizations driving them. Edwin Amenta and Neal Caren identify hundreds of movement organizations, from the Women’s Christian Temperance Union to Occupy Wall Street, and document their treatment in the news. In doing so, Amenta and Caren provide an alternative account of US history from below, as it was refracted through journalistic lenses.

Iconic organizations in the women’s rights, African American civil rights, and environmental movements gained substantial media attention. But so too did now-forgotten groups, such as the German-American Alliance, Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies, and Peace and Freedom Party. Amenta and Caren show why some organizations made big news while others did not, why some were treated well while others were handled roughly. They recover forgotten stories, including that of the Townsend Plan, a Depression-era organization that helped establish Social Security. They also reveal that the media handled the civil rights movement far more harshly than popular histories recount. And they detail the difficulties movements face in today’s brave new media world.

Drawing from digitized newspapers across a century and through to the present, Rough Draft of History offers insights for those seeking social and political change and those trying to make sense of it.},

In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the US Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

We present a form that data statements can take and explore the implications of adopting them as part of regular practice. We argue that data statements will help alleviate issues related to exclusion and bias in language technology, lead to better precision in claims about how natural language processing research can generalize and thus better engineering results, protect companies from public embarrassment, and ultimately lead to language technology that meets its users in their own preferred linguistic style and furthermore does not misrepresent them to others.},

In this work, we measure gender biases on models trained with different abusive language datasets, while analyzing the effect of different pre-trained word embeddings and model architectures. We also experiment with three bias mitigation methods: (1) debiased word embeddings, (2) gender swap data augmentation, and (3) fine-tuning with a larger corpus. These methods can effectively reduce gender bias by 90-98\% and can be extended to correct model bias in other scenarios.},

We examine racial bias in five different sets of Twitter data annotated for hate speech and abusive language. We train classifiers on these datasets and compare the predictions of these classifiers on tweets written in African-American English with those written in Standard American English. The results show evidence of systematic racial bias in all datasets, as classifiers trained on them tend to predict that tweets written in African-American English are abusive at substantially higher rates. If these abusive language detection systems are used in the field they will therefore have a disproportionate negative impact on African-American social media users. Consequently, these systems may discriminate against the groups who are often the targets of the abuse we are trying to detect.},

The results showed that African American tweets were up to 3.7 times more likely to be labeled as abusive, and African American male tweets were up to 77\% more likely to be labeled as hateful compared to the others. These patterns were statistically significant and robust even when party identification was added as a control variable.

	abstract = {We introduce the language of measurement modeling from the quantitative social sciences as a framework for understanding fairness in computational systems. Computational systems often involve unobservable theoretical constructs, such as "creditworthiness," "teacher quality," or "risk to society," that cannot be measured directly and must instead be inferred from observable properties thought to be related to them---i.e., operationalized via a measurement model. This process introduces the potential for mismatch between the theoretical understanding of the construct purported to be measured and its operationalization. Indeed, we argue that many of the harms discussed in the literature on fairness in computational systems are direct results of such mismatches. Further complicating these discussions is the fact that fairness itself is an unobservable theoretical construct. Moreover, it is an essentially contested construct---i.e., it has many different theoretical understandings depending on the context. We argue that this contestedness underlies recent debates about fairness definitions: disagreements that appear to be about contradictory operationalizations are, in fact, disagreements about different theoretical understandings of the construct itself. By introducing the language of measurement modeling, we provide the computer science community with a process for making explicit and testing assumptions about unobservable theoretical constructs, thereby making it easier to identify, characterize, and even mitigate fairness-related harms.},

With a data set that tracks the most popular Google search terms in 199 countries between 2004 and 2014, and drawing on Gabriel de Tarde, this article introduces a theoretical framework to examine how country-level differences shape global imitation of cultural interests and consumer tastes. Contrary to popular accounts, this study finds that cross-national diffusion is surprisingly rare—and seldom U.S. led—but occurs through a multichannel network with many different centers. Negative binomial regression models applied to cases of diffusion in 346,620 country-year dyads reveal that global imitation flows are likely patterned by the power and prestige of countries, their proximities to each other, and the cultural boundaries between them. Accounting for factors such as the influence of large organizations does not disrupt these findings.},

We propose that a combination of text-mining tools addressing different layers of meaning facilitates a closer analysis of the dynamics of manifest and latent meanings than is currently acknowledged. To illustrate our approach, we combine grammatical parsing and topic modeling to operationalize communication structures within sentences and the semantic surroundings of these communication structures. We use a reliable and downloadable software application to analyze the dynamic interlacement of two layers of meaning over time.

This study fills such a gap by applying an integrated classification framework to the analysis of the commonalities and differences in political issues that appeared in 78,305 articles from Asian American and African American newspapers from the 1960s to the 1980s. The automated text classification shows that Asian American newspapers focused on promoting collective gains more often than African American newspapers. Conversely, African American newspapers concentrated on preventing collective losses more than Asian American newspapers. The content analysis demonstrates that the issue priorities varied between the corpora, especially with respect to policy contexts. Gaining access to government resources was a more urgent issue for Asian Americans, while reducing or ending state violence, such as police brutality, was a more pressing matter for African Americans. It also helped avoid extreme interpretations of the machine coding, as the misalignment of political agendas between the two corpora widened up to 10 times when the training data were measured using the minimum, rather than the maximum, reliability threshold.},

These approaches perform well on tasks like information extraction, but their ability to identify complex, socially constructed, and unsettled theoretical concepts—a central goal of sociological content analysis—has not been tested. To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches—dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning—to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.},

How these biases become culturally entrenched is less well understood. In particular, previous research has neglected the role of information transmission processes in perpetuating cultural biases. In this study, I combine insights from the cultural cognition, affect control theory, and cultural transmission frameworks to examine how one form of internalized culture—fundamental cultural sentiments—affects the content of information shared in communication. I argue that individuals communicate narratives in ways that minimize deflection of internalized cultural sentiments, resulting in cultural-consistency bias. I test this proposition using a serial transmission study in which participants read and retell short stories. Results show that culturally inconsistent, high-deflection information experiences an initial boost in memorability, but consistency biases ultimately win out as information is altered to increase cultural consistency, demonstrating that deflection provides a promising measure of cultural schema-consistency. This measure is predictive of the information that individuals share in communication and changes to this information in the transmission process.},

Yet these new data sources lack critical information about the broader social context of collective behavior—or protect it behind strict privacy barriers. In this article, I introduce social media survey apps (SMSAs) that adjoin computational social science methods with conventional survey techniques in order to enable more comprehensive analysis of collective behavior online. SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.},

The first, pattern detection step, involves inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step, assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient, rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic field notes, and can address many potential research questions.},

We survey some of the most exciting computational approaches to text analysis, highlighting both supervised methods that extend old theories to new data and unsupervised techniques that discover hidden regularities worth theorizing. We then review recent research that uses these tools to develop social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identified through heterogeneous signals within communication.

	abstract = {Drawing on large-scale computational data and methods, this research demonstrates how polarization efforts are influenced by a patterned network of political and financial actors. These dynamics, which have been notoriously difficult to quantify, are illustrated here with a computational analysis of climate change politics in the United States. The comprehensive data include all individual and organizational actors in the climate change countermovement (164 organizations), as well as all written and verbal texts produced by this network between 1993–2013 (40,785 texts, more than 39 million words). Two main findings emerge. First, that organizations with corporate funding were more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly, that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that thematic content over time. These findings provide new, and comprehensive, confirmation of dynamics long thought to be at the root of climate change politics and discourse. Beyond the specifics of climate change, this paper has important implications for understanding ideological polarization more generally, and the increasing role of private funding in determining why certain polarizing themes are created and amplified. Lastly, the paper suggests that future studies build on the novel approach taken here that integrates large-scale textual analysis with social networks.},

	abstract = {The rise of the Internet, social media, and digitized historical archives has produced a colossal amount of text-based data in recent years. While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First, I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of automated text-classification methods to classify different types of culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of information about the social context in which texts are produced, the construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently necessary to work with big data.},

Using tools from computer science, we construct a novel dataset allowing us to examine whether the musical features of nearly 27,000 songs from Billboard’s Hot 100 charts predict their levels of success in this cultural market. We find that, in addition to artist familiarity, genre affiliation, and institutional support, a song’s perceived proximity to its peers influences its position on the charts. Contrary to the claim that all popular music sounds the same, we find that songs sounding too much like previous and contemporaneous productions—those that are highly typical—are less likely to succeed. Songs exhibiting some degree of optimal differentiation are more likely to rise to the top of the charts. These findings offer a new perspective on success in cultural markets by specifying how content organizes product competition and audience consumption behavior.},

I achieved 90\% overall accuracy for classifying the nonprofits into nine broad categories and 88\% for classifying them into 25 major groups. The intercoder reliabilities between algorithms and human coders measured by kappa statistics are in the “almost perfect” range of .80 to 1.00. The results suggest that a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm can approximate human coders and substantially improve researchers’ productivity. I also reassigned multiple category codes to more than 439,000 nonprofits and discovered a considerable amount of organizational activities that were previously ignored. The classifier is an essential methodological prerequisite for large-N and Big Data analyses, and the remapped U.S. nonprofit sector can serve as an important instrument for asking or reexamining fundamental questions of nonprofit studies.

Our review reveals that sociologists are not only at the center of cutting-edge research that addresses longstanding questions about human behavior but also developing new lines of inquiry about digital spaces as well.

Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years, we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education, which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with cultivated taste.},

This article focuses on how the STM is helpful for survey researchers and experimentalists. The STM makes analyzing open-ended responses easier, more revealing, and capable of being used to estimate treatment effects.

We introduce a conceptual framework for making causal inferences with discovered measures as a treatment or outcome. Our framework enables researchers to discover high-dimensional textual interventions and estimate the ways that observed treatments affect text-based outcomes. We argue that nearly all text-based causal inferences depend upon a latent representation of the text and we provide a framework to learn the latent representation. But estimating this latent representation, we show, creates new risks: we may introduce an identification problem or overfit. To address these risks we describe a split-sample framework and apply it to estimate causal effects from an experiment on immigration attitudes and a study on bureaucratic response.

	abstract = {We propose a method for measuring a text’s engagement with a focal concept using distributional representations of the meaning of words. More specifically, this measure relies on word mover’s distance, which uses word embeddings to determine similarities between two documents. In our approach, which we call Concept Mover’s Distance, a document is measured by the minimum distance the words in the document need to travel to arrive at the position of a “pseudo document” consisting of only words denoting a focal concept. This approach captures the prototypical structure of concepts, is fairly robust to pruning sparse terms as well as variation in text lengths within a corpus, and with pre-trained embeddings, can be used even when terms denoting concepts are absent from corpora and can be applied to bag-of-words datasets. We close by outlining some limitations of the proposed method as well as opportunities for future research.},

It highlights the kinds of novel insights available to sociologists using big data while also pointing out the shortcomings and pitfalls even the best researchers fall victim to. One of these insights is that what constitutes “big data” is always changing as the size, type, and scale of data evolves. Big data comes in three varieties: digitalized life, digital trace data, and digital life. All three of these sources of big data can be instrumented. People can build new repositories of data, create applications that collect digital traces, or simulate online social interaction in digital worlds. Much of sociology is based on self-reported data. National surveys, political polls, even the census are premised on people accurately and faithfully remembering and reporting things about themselves. The chapter concludes by articulating some coming changes in big data likely to reshape sociological research.},

We foreground the theoretical, empirical, and institutional opportunities and challenges of Computational Communication Science (CCS) that are relevant to the political communication community. We also assess understandings of CCS and highlight challenges associated with data and resource requirements, as well as those connected with the theory and semantics of digital signals. With an eye to existing practices, we elaborate on the key role of infrastructures, academic institutions, ethics, and training in computational methods.

Big Data has introduced to the social sciences new data sources, new research methods, new researchers, and new forms of data storage that have immediate and potential effects on the ethics and practice of qualitative research. Drawing from a literature review and insights gathered at a National Science Foundation-funded workshop in 2016, we present five principles for qualitative researchers and their institutions to consider in navigating these emerging research landscapes. These principles include (a) valuing methodological diversity; (b) encouraging research that accounts for and retains context, specificity, and marginalized and overlooked populations; (c) pushing beyond legal concerns to address often messy ethical dilemmas; (d) attending to regional and disciplinary differences; and (e) considering the entire lifecycle of research, including the data afterlife in archives or in open-data facilities.},

In doing so, we seek to stimulate more cross-disciplinary debate and exchange. We caution against unifying accounts of quantification and highlight the importance of tracking quantification across different sites in order to appreciate its essential ambiguity and conduct more systematic investigations of interactions between different quantification regimes.},

This has often been associated with the terms “big data” and “computational social science.” Using such data, social scientists have argued, will enable us to better understand social, political, and economic life. Yet this new data type comes not only with promises but with challenges as well. These include developing standards for data collection, preparation, analysis, and reporting; establishing more systematic links between established theories within the existing body of research in the social sciences; and moving away from proofs-of-concepts toward the systematic development and testing of hypotheses. In this article, we map these promises and challenges in detail and introduce five highly innovative contributions collected in this special issue. These articles illustrate impressively the potential of digital trace data in the social science all the while remaining conscious of its pitfalls.},

We discuss the benefits and challenges of using digital trace data for social and demographic research, and we review examples of current demographic literature that creatively use digital trace data to study processes related to fertility, mortality, and migration. Focusing on Facebook data for advertisers—a novel “digital census” that has largely been untapped by demographers—we provide illustrative and empirical examples of how demographic researchers can manage issues such as bias and representation when using digital trace data.

Many academics and practitioners have warned against the naive usage of social data. There are biases and inaccuracies occurring at the source of the data, but also introduced during processing. There are methodological limitations and pitfalls, as well as ethical boundaries and unexpected consequences that are often overlooked.

I argue that the adoption of big data analytics facilitates amplifications of prior surveillance practices and fundamental transformations in surveillance activities. First, discretionary assessments of risk are supplemented and quantified using risk scores. Second, data are used for predictive, rather than reactive or explanatory, purposes. Third, the proliferation of automatic alert systems makes it possible to systematically surveil an unprecedentedly large number of people. Fourth, the threshold for inclusion in law enforcement databases is lower, now including individuals who have not had direct police contact. Fifth, previously separate data systems are merged, facilitating the spread of surveillance into a wide range of institutions. Based on these findings, I develop a theoretical model of big data surveillance that can be applied to institutional domains beyond the criminal justice system. Finally, I highlight the social consequences of big data surveillance for law and social inequality.},

	abstract = {Donald Trump’s election in 2016 sparked a major upsurge in protest in the U.S. In the year after the historic Women’s March, activists held more than 6,500 protest events with two million participants across nearly 850 counties in all fifty states and Washington, DC. Activists focused on a broad set of issues including health care, abortion, the environment, science, and political corruption. Racial, ethnic, and immigration politics comprised central and durable themes. We take stock of this wave of protest with a protest focused on race, ethnicity, and immigration using protest event data. Our analysis has two main components. First, we present a descriptive profile tracking the prominence of racial, ethnic, and immigration events between the first and second women’s marches. Second, we examine local variation in racial and immigration mobilization motivated by central expectations in social movement theory. Our analyses focus on the role of partisan political dynamics, prior movement activity, and threat as major drivers of movement mobilization. We find that attendance at protests on racial and immigration issues was highest in cities with a prior history of activism; Democratic votes also predicted protests overall but did not predict racial or immigration protests after controlling for participation in the women’s march protests. The size of the immigrant population affects immigration protests.},

For this, we differentiate between two main types of social collectives: non-organized collectives, which exhibit loosely coupled collective behavior, and collective actors with a separate identity and strategic capability. Further, we examine the newness, or distinctive traits, of online-based collectives, which we identify as being the strong and hitherto non-existent interplay between the technological infrastructures that these collectives are embedded in and the social processes of coordination and institutionalization they must engage in, in order to maintain their viability over time.

How are crowd-enabled networks activated, structured, and maintained in the absence of recognized leaders, common goals, or conventional organization, issue framing, and action coordination? We develop an analytical framework for examining the organizational processes of crowd-enabled connective action such as was found in the Arab Spring, the 15-M in Spain, and Occupy Wall Street. The analysis points to three elemental modes of peer production that operate together to create organization in crowds: the production, curation, and dynamic integration of various types of information content and other resources that become distributed and utilized across the crowd. Whereas other peer-production communities such as open-source software developers or Wikipedia typically evolve more highly structured participation environments, crowds create organization through packaging these elemental peer-production mechanisms to achieve various kinds of work. The workings of these ‘production packages’ are illustrated with a theory-driven analysis of Twitter data from the 2011–2012 US Occupy movement, using an archive of some 60 million tweets. This analysis shows how the Occupy crowd produced various organizational routines, and how the different production mechanisms were nested in each other to create relatively complex organizational results.},

This article explores this loosely bound media ecology, focusing on how and what types of video content are shared and circulated across both YouTube and Twitter. Developing a novel data-collection methodology, a population of videos posted to YouTube with Occupy-related metadata or circulated on Twitter alongside Occupy-related keywords during the month of November 2011 was assembled. In addition to harvesting metadata related to view count and video ratings on YouTube and the number of times a video was tweeted, a probability sample of 1100 videos was hand coded, with an emphasis on classifying video genre and type, borrowed sources of content, and production quality. The novelty of the data set and the techniques adapted for analysing it allow one to take an important step beyond cataloging Occupy-related videos to examine whether and how videos are circulated on Twitter. A variety of practices were uncovered that link YouTube and Twitter together, including sharing cell phone footage as eyewitness accounts of protest (and police) activity, digging up news footage or movie clips posted months and sometimes years before the movement began; and the sharing of music videos and other entertainment content in the interest of promoting solidarity or sociability among publics created through shared hashtags. This study demonstrates both the need for, and challenge of, conducting social media research that accommodates data from multiple platforms.},

	abstract = {This article asks whether and under what circumstances a presence in news media debates helps advocacy groups to achieve their policy goals in European Union (EU) legislative politics. Common wisdom holds that lobbyists eschew the public spotlight and prefer to influence policymaking from behind the scenes. This perception contrasts with the literature on media and interest groups, which typically conceives of media attention as a crucial commodity for interest groups to influence policy decisions. This article unites these seemingly contrasting stances by arguing that media attention can be both a blessing and a curse for advocacy. The central argument posited is that media attention may improve or reduce advocacy groups’ chances of preference attainment depending on how advocacy groups frame their message in the news. The analyses draw from interviews with more than 200 policy practitioners and content analysis of 3,557 media statements connected to a sample of 125 EU policy proposals. The findings demonstrate that an advocacy group’s media presence may improve preference attainment, but only when the advocacy group manages to frame its objectives in the news as aligned with the public interest.},

From there we examine the arguments offered to answer questions about US social policy as well as the research strategies and evidence used to appraise the arguments. We address work that situates US social policy in comparative perspective as well as work that examines the development of American social policy historically or across states. Although many lines of argumentation have some empirical support, we find that some lines of political and institutional analyses provide the best supported answers to the questions and the greatest potential for wide usage in comparative and historical studies. We conclude that scholars would do well not to treat American social policy as so exceptional as to require separate images, explanations, and approaches. We suggest promising new lines of empirical inquiry prompted by new conceptualizations of social policy and other developments in this literature.},

Examining the influence of the U.S. old-age pension movement, which involved millions of people, this article appraises the mediation model using state-level data from the 1930s and 1940s on Old Age Assistance—the main support for the aged at the time-and a Senate vote for generous senior citizens' pensions in 1939. Our models control for other potential influences, notably public opinion, which is often ignored in empirical studies and sometimes claimed to be responsible for causal influence mistakenly attributed to challengers. We employ pooled cross-sectional and time series analyses and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (FSQCA), which is especially suited to appraising the combinational expectations of the political mediation model. Both sets of analyses show that the pension movement was directly influential on the outcomes and provide support for the political mediation arguments.},

In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of “political opportunity,” is not part of the solution. Our results support the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts.},

To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy. Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior.

As for the conditions under which movements matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies, organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face. Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make more comparisons across movements and issues.},

By drawing attention to movements’ issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers’ focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.},

Using aggregated, cross- sectional survey data on political involvement from 34,241 respondents, we examine changes in the probability of ever having attended a protest or signed a petition over time periods and across cohorts using cross-classified, random-effects models. We find a strong generational effect on the probability of ever having attended a protest, which explains much of the observed change in self-reports of protest behavior. More than half of this generational effect is a result of compositional change, but we find little evidence that protest attendance dif- fused to new types of actors. We compare these findings with a less confrontational form of protesting, petition signing, which shows more period than cohort effects.

Method – This paper uses extensive data collected from Stormfront, the largest online community of white nationalists, for the period from September 2001 to August 2010 totaling 6,868,674 posts. We systematically analyzed the data to allow for a detailed depiction of SMOCs using keyword tags. We also used Stata 11 to analyze descriptive measures such as persistence of user presence and relation of first post to length of stay.

Findings – Our findings suggest that SMOCs provide a new forum for social movements that produces a unique set of characteristics. Nevertheless, many characteristics of SMOCs are also in line with conventional offline SMCs.

Originality of the paper – This research broadens our understanding of the differences between online and offline SMCs and presents the special case of the SMOC as a way for scholars to conceptualize and study social movements that use the Internet to form their collective identity.},

Using a database of 1500 Facebook Occupy group pages, we analyze the types of posts that recruit new users. In the case of the Occupy movement, the success of recruiting over 400,000 users to Facebook was driven by user-created content produced in a medium that encourages contributions and sharing to an existing set of dense networks of potential movement sympathizers. We find that the posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and status updates. We also find that posts that use confrontational messages and messages about solidarity appear most often in the top posts. Our findings suggest that online social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter provide a powerful tool for movements to rapidly spread information and reach broad audiences. In addition, we offer some analysis of the impact of these findings for social movements that hope to utilize Facebook.},

	abstract = {The Tea Party Movement (TPM) burst onto the political scene following the 2008 elections. Early on, the movement attracted broad public support and seemed to tap into a variety of cultural concerns rooted in the changing demographic, political, and economic face of the nation. However, some observers questioned whether the Tea Party represented anything more than routine partisan backlash. And what had started as a seemingly grassroots movement that changed the face of American politics in the 2010 election was reduced to being mainly a caucus within Congress by 2012. In this article, we examine the cultural and political dimensions of Tea Party support over time. Using polling data from North Carolina and Tennessee and quantitative media analysis, we provide new evidence that cultural dispositions in addition to conservative identification were associated with TPM favorability in 2010; that these dispositions crystallized into shared political positions in 2011; and that by 2012 little distinguished TPM adherents from other conservatives.},

First, we elaborate a theoretical argument that builds from the political mediation theory of movement consequences and incorporates the social organization of newspaper practices. This media and political mediation model integrates political and media contexts and organizations' characteristics and actions. With this model, we hypothesize two main routes to coverage: one that includes changes in public policy and involves policy‐engaged, well‐resourced, and inclusive organizations and a second that combines social crises and protest organizations. Second, we appraise these arguments with the first analysis of the national coverage of all organizations in a social movement over its career: 84 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights and AIDS‐related organizations in the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Wall Street Journal from 1969 to 2010. These analyses go beyond previous research that provides either snapshots of many organizations at one point in time or overtime analyses of aggregated groups of organizations or individual organizations. The results of both historical and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses support our media and political mediation model.},

	abstract = {Social movement scholars have considered several political and cultural consequences of social movements, but have paid limited attention to whether and how social movements shape discourse. We develop a theory of discursive eruption, referring to the ability of radical movements to initially ignite media coverage but not control the content once other actors— particularly those that can take advantage of journalistic norms—enter the discourse. We hold that one long-term outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues. We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further, we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement. These findings highlight the importance of social movements in shaping discourse and indicate that social movement scholars should further consider discursive changes as a consequence of social movements.},

	abstract = {Background: While research has demonstrated a link between the built environment and obesity, much variation remains unexplained. Physical features are necessary, but not sufficient, for physical activity: residents must choose to use these features in health-promoting ways. This article reveals a role for local culture in tempering the effect of the physical environment on physical activity behaviors.

Methods: We developed Systematic Cultural Observation (SCO) to observe place-based, health-related culture in Lenoir County, NC (population {\textasciitilde}60,000). Photographs (N = 6450) were taken systematically from 150 most-used road segments and geocoded. Coders assessed physical activity (PA) opportunities (e.g., public or private activity spaces, pedestrian-friendly features) and presence of people in each photograph.

Results: 28.7\% of photographs contained some PA feature. Most were private or pedestrian; 3.1\% contained public PA space. Only 1.5\% of photographs with any PA features (2\% of those with public PA space, 0.7\% of those with private) depicted people despite appropriate weather and daylight conditions.

Conclusions: Even when PA opportunities existed in this rural county, they were rarely used. This may be the result of culture (“unbuilt environment”) that disfavors physical activity even in the presence of features that allow it. Policies promoting built environments designed for healthy lifestyles should consider local culture (shared styles, skills, habits, and beliefs) to maximize positive outcomes.},

	abstract = {Does contentious collective action matter? Whereas most social movement literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy change outcomes, this paper takes a different approach by bringing the question to a global context and examines democratization as a structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several hypotheses about the ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious collective action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as the cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of previous studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national model to examine potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of protest activities. Using data from 103 non-democratic countries from 1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots increase the probability that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find that while contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that lead to political liberalization, increase the count of contentious events, thus indirectly boosting liberalization. We find no evidence that protest significantly increases the chances of deliberalization. Together, our findings show a key role for non-elite political actors to influence political liberalization.},

I provide empirical support by examining Senate voting outcomes in the 2010 midterm election and show that increases in Democratic voting were most pronounced in counties with high Tea Party rally activity.

	abstract = {What is the relationship between social movements and electoral politics? Although the empirical reality of American politics has increasingly blurred the lines between activism and electoral politics, sociology has yet to explore these changes and provide theoretical and methodological tools to understand them. Focusing on the experience of young Americans, this review explores this relationship and outlines opportunities for future research. It is broken down into three sections. First, I review the main themes in the study of youth political participation in America. Second, using examples from the 2008 election, the article examines recent increases in youth participation. Third and finally, this article discusses the case of the Obama campaign, its transition into the Democratic National Committee's Organizing for America, and aspects of the 2012 election to highlight the complex relationship between movements and electoral politics in America today. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities for sociologists to bridge the connections between activism and electoral politics in new and meaningful ways.},

Conflict Prevented Through Contact. Numerous examples have been encountered where the work of staff members of the Commission or of State Councils of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching,® or local committees have been instrumental in preventing lynchings or other forms of violence. This has been accomplished largely through direct contact with law enforcement officers, or through getting influential citizens in the conflict area to get in touch with local law enforcement officials. Under such pressure, even when feeling runs high, local officials usually make an attempt to enforce the law. Of course, the speed with which a lynching may occur sometimes makes it impossible for the conflict situation to be known to the members of the State Council before it takes place.

459
Lynching has been justified in the past on the ground that it was necessary for the protection of white women. The work of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching has helped to undermine and discredit this supposition. Through the Association, nearly 45,000 women and 1,318 peace officers pledged themselves to work for the eradication of lynching and to impress upon the South that lynching is unnecessary for the protection of southern women.
Since the period 1916-1920, when the Commission was organized (1919), lynchings decreased from 300 to 189 in 1920-1925; to 88 during the period 1925-1930; to 84 from 1930 to 1935; to 30 from 1935 to 1940; to 4 in 1941; and to 5 in 1942.10

Reduction of Lynching a Cooperative Achievement. No thesis is presented bearing the claim that the work of the Commission on Interracial Cooperation or the work of local and State interracial organizations has been entirely responsible for the great decrease in lynching. The New Deal, with its sympathetic attitude toward minorities, the growth of State highway patrols; better communication, such as radio; the far-reaching influence of the churches; the activities of Tuskegee Institute; the work of the NAACP and the Urban League, all have made their contribution to an effective reduction in lynching.! Above the efforts of any single agency operating in the South to reduce lynching, the work of the Commission seems to emerge as singularly significant.

For nearly half a century now many organizations and movements have been active in
efforts to bring about changes in race relations. They have represented a multiplicity of approaches and techniques, striving for “improvement,” “reconciliation,” “race harmony,” “fellowship,” “uplift,” “interracial justice,” “integration.” No notable agreement on working principles or basic philosophy of action has been apparent, nor has any impressive record of concrete achievement been registered, tested and proved and commensurate with the effort expended. Fundamental to a realistic approach to social change in race relations are the critical appraisal of action agencies, of. basic postulates, and an increasing attention to the formulation of a theory and strategy that will explain, project consequences, and guide action.
Review of techniques that other’s have theorized.
Most relevenat for movement folks:

The militant, aggressive approach. Included here are pressures of lobbies, legal pressure through test cases, suits, injunctions, legal aid to defendants, political action in party campaigns, personal protest and challenge, demonstrations, picketing, exposés, boycotts.
This approach is best illustrated by the activities of all those pressure groups which use tactics of aggressive assertion of rights and the forcing of issues as weapons with which to gain immediate recognition and advantage. It is exemplified by the “March on Washington” movement and by threats of mass civil disobedience by Negroes if the military inequities of the last wartime experience should be repeated. It is constantly encountered in uncompromising demands of individuals and groups, in representations to governmental bodies, in the press. It is expressed by spokesmen of organizations in the midst of other crises and chronically, radically and subtly.
…This observation on the division and disagreement in one particular is suggestive of the lack of consensus prevailing in the field as a whole. 
Concludes with a pretty unsupported criticism of things moving too fast:
A growing and responsible criticism of social action in all phases of intergroup relations, with emphasis on the realism and promise of sound theory and strategy.

Sources of conflict: Resources!

t there be distinctly different ways to mobilize resources. In our case, this means a choice between appealing for mass support and obtaining resources in other ways; in another context it would include appealing to different sectors of the population for support.
3. Individual competition is facilitated by a weak or ambiguous prestige structure. Social control over potential leaders and loyalty to factions.can exist only to the extent that the Negro subcommunity is in fact a subcommunity with binding integrative attachment mechanisms.


It is probably true that organized competition is beneficial to a civil rights movement in that it stimulates the most intense (though sometimes short-lived) activity. On the other hand, individual competition, which produces a constant circulation of leaders, probably equips the movement best for sustained activity over a period of years. However, the city without competition is probably best able to carry out a tightly planned campaign to achieve specific goals, although in the process its small leadership may become stolid and lose the initiative to raise new issues or the courage to use ultimate sanctions.

Socioeconomic and legal changes in the position of southern Negroes have been accompanied by a changing pattern of race relations and a new attitude on the part of Negro leaders. Data from a closed-answer questionnaire administered to students in three Negro colleges in North Carolina support the hypothesis that sit-in protests are less indicative of social alienation among Negroes than of their identification with or positive reference to the white middle class.
For Negro college students and for Negro business and professional people, the nonmembership reference group is considered to be persons of similar position and training in the white community.

It is probable that other forms of Negro protest can appropriately be seen as expressions of alienation and disaffection. It may be that the students in our study are not representative of those from other schools who have innervated other protests. But the affirmative, optimistic, tolerant aspect shown by the students generally, and by the active participants especially, demands explanation.
Socialized to value respectability and achievement, educated to affirm their right of equal opportunity, legitimized in their expectations by civil rights legislation and an important body of opinion, living in a college environment where freedom from constraints and ease of communication facilitate the development and spread of protest activity, these students have selected nonviolent protest as an acceptable means of demonstrating their anger at barriers to first-class citizenship. Far from being alienated, the students appear to be committed to the society and its middle class leaders. If our “reference group” hypothesis is generally correct, we need to find out where the groups’ boundaries are drawn—who is included in and who excluded from both the membership and the non-membership groups. We need to discover how these boundary lines shift as the protests have varying degrees of success or failure. We should like to locate the point at which faith in negotiation and nonviolent protest dissolves into cynicism and either indifference or attack.

	abstract = {This paper investigates the question of whether and how race and race relations affect state legislators’ support for restrictive immigration policy. Focusing on the nine new immigration destinations in the US Southeast, we compare the roll call votes cast by African American and White Democratic state legislators on 196 restrictive immigration measures proposed between 2005 and 2012. Overall, the majority of Black Democratic legislators support restrictive immigration legislation, although at a consistently lower rate than White Democratic legislators. We test hypotheses that Black-White differences in support for restrictive immigration legislation depend upon the material resources at stake and the symbolic significance associated with specific legislation. Using bill topic to measure these conditions, we find that Black and White Democrats equally support immigrant “competition” bills on employment topics. Black Democratic legislators are less likely than their White counterparts to support immigration bills on Black-immigrant “commonalities” topics related to civil rights issues: voter ID regulations, education, police, and omnibus restrictions. Further, for civil rights bills only, district threat indicators such as a rapidly growing district Latino population are much more likely to increase support for restrictive immigration bills among White Democratic legislators than among Black Democratic legislators. Some district characteristics even evoke a commonalities response from African American Democratic legislators, reducing their support for restrictive legislation. Our research thus expands the competition/commonalities debate and highlights the complexities and contingencies of race relations and state policymaking in the twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {An under-analyzed and under-theorized aspect of riot participation is its highly gendered character: Men typically are more likely than women to riot or be willing to riot. To account for this gender-violence link, we look beyond the social-movement literature by drawing on general strain theory within criminology. Using survey data of blacks taken during the peak of rioting in 1968, multivariate analyses support several hypotheses derived from general strain theory. One reason why black men are more likely than black women to riot is that men report much higher levels of police mistreatment and such individual-level strains are a strong predictor of riot participation. Because violence conflicts with gendered behavioral expectations and related socialization processes for women, we also find that women require high levels of a particular violence-inducing emotion (disappointment about racial progress) to be equally likely as men to be riot participants. These observations call for greater attention to micro-level strain and related emotions in the study of social-movement processes. Results also highlight the continued relevance of selective aspects of breakdown theories of the 1950s and 1960s. We conclude by speculating that the link between gender and rioting helps us understand why authorities and third parties reacted in such harsh and unsympathetic ways to the civil rights movement in the late 1960s.},

Goal diversity increases the rate of protest, whereas tactical diversity increases the likelihood of achieving a desired policy outcome.

Mobilization efforts benefit when movement framing is congruent with local structural conditions. This mobilization, in turn, produces political leverage for the movement through its capacity to deliver support of its members and adherents. Its political advantage may be offset, however, if another of its key framing activities, the construction of collective identity boundaries, alienates the broader population and stimulates a backlash. Such backlash is also intimately connected to structural conditions because its potential is a function of the characteristics of the local population -- specifically, the proportion of the population alienated by the movement's boundary construction. We apply these arguments to the case of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and show that while the Klan's diagnostic and prognostic framing may have resonated structurally and facilitated the Klan's mobilization efforts, its exclusionary boundaries frustrated its attempts to secure broader political gains.},

It seems apparent that groups of men, by careful analysis of existing situations, by making plans based thereon, by organizing and by exerting various kinds of influence, can achieve certain desired goals. Consequently, there is interest both from the theoretical and from the practical approach in the techniques and methods of social action.

Distiquish what is modern science from old sociology:
There is a gripping fear on the part of teachers of sociology that they may be thought of as the religious reformer type of earlier social philosopher who so frequently left the ministry and took up teaching sociology.
SM can be used to study social action, as recently popularized by Parsons, more generally.
A social movement may be roughly defined as “a joint endeavor of a considerable group of persons to alter or change the course of events by their joint activities.” The term “events” is somewhat vague but has the advantage of signifying action taking place, things coming to pass. The implication is, that if the movement did not take place, the changes would not ensue, the “events” would not have transpired. The standpoint is voluntaristic but the analysis of the various factors that condition and influence group behavior is, of course, included in the study.
During the last four years, classes at Temple University studying “Modern Social Movements,” have investigated in the following areas: in the educational field, Progressive Education, Workers Education, Parent Education; in the economic field, The Cooperative Movement, the C.I.O., Dr. Townsend’s movement for old age security, Social Insurance, The National Association of Manufacturers; in the area of health and social Welfare, Socialized Medicine, Birth Control, Housing; in the field of conflict, Anti-Semitism, The Ku Klux Klan; in the political sphere, The Communist Movement in America, The American Socialist Party, Ghandi’s Pacifist Movement in India, The Peace Movement in America; in the field of religion, The Bahai Cult, The Great I Am Sect, The Mormons, The Oxford Group, The Quaker Movement, Zionism, Father Divine and his cult.
Things to study:
Origin, History, and DevelopmentThe Organization of the MovementTechniques of Spreading the MovementSatisfactions DerivedEvaluation of the Objectives and Result of the Movement
Note that the Satisfactio is the individual level -- “economic needs” and “frustrations”

Townsend’s rapid increase of adherents, similarly, is related to the changing economic and familial situation that left millions of older people without economic security. On the other hand, the birth control movement attained a degree of acceptance and an increasing number of followers in spite of the mores of our culture and in spite of constant opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. ….There is, of course, always a combination of the efforts of a group of protagonists and the particular setting which evokes and facilitates a movement.
Talks about how some movements have strong leaders while others do not. 
In other cases the leader merely expounded or promoted an idea or a plan which is taken over by a large number of persons, elaborated and extended. Other movements are not so closely linked with an outstanding leader. The Ku Klux Kian, founded by a small group, represents the struggle of a class of people to maintain status. 

Joining
A good many of them, for example the Ku Klux Klan, the Townsend movement, and to a large extent the National Socialist movement, may be interpreted as drawing membership because it is believed that through them status can be maintained, frustrations overcome, a secure place in the community attained. 
…Those who wish to lead in influencing large numbers to change attitudes, to adopt policies, to further programs, should be sensitive to crisis situations, to unfulfilled needs, and thwarted human cravings, and present their programs in terms of the nature of these demands.
It is possible to combine careful research and wide experimentation with the building of a movement for social change. Magnetic leadership, emotional appeal will draw certain types of people if and when they are in critical situations, but substantial movements may be built in the absence of such situations.

Revolution is a type of social disorganization. It represents a cycle: social change—crisis—resolution of the crisis—equilibrium. Revolution can, therefore, be described as a whole: societal inadequacy plus emergent action brings adequacy. It may also be described as a continuing societal adjustment the phases of which are: pre-critical, critical, and post-critical. The fundamental problem of the study of revolution becomes one of accounting for the shift from one phase to another. What, then, is the process of behavior which will explain this transition? Moreover, can one find a process of behavior which will not only account for this cyclical transition in revolution but at the same time explain the patterns of behavior which characterize the phases? The thesis which is being argued here is that these three phases of revolutionary period may be described in terms of the process of behavior which may be styled “the dialectic of the situation.”
….
But in any case the collapse of the sense of frustration,—whether due to the elimination of the older constants, or to the feeling that revolutionary action is producing new constants, or to the canalization of frustration through displaced aggressive patterns,—brings the end of the critical phase of the revolutionary period. New ends which can utilize and direct the new means and conditions, whether of a restricted or expanded nature, appear; a new normative orientation emerges in keeping with existing means-ends-conditions. The cycle of revolutionary social action is completed. The post-critical phase brings a calm between storms.

Influenced by pyshoclogical conceptions of “role” 
The role of a propagandist in a popular social movement varies with the external power structure, that is, with the degree of active or latent resistance in the population to those institutional changes advanced by the movement. However the role is examined—whether from the point of view of the content and style of the propaganda or from that of the prestige of the propagandist in the movement or from that of the way propaganda activities are organized and carried out—its structure reflects the movement’s success or failure to realize its objectives, a success or failure measured by the extent to which potential sympathisers accept the movement’s ideology, and, indirectly, by the movement’s ability to overcome opposition to its program. In order to examine these variations in the propagandist’s role, we may distinguish three phases in the development of a social movement. The first, and the one with which we shall be chiefly concerned here, may be called ideational. In this phase propaganda is the major activity. Members of the insurgent social movement must make their program familiar to audiences, must convince their listeners to take action, and must, if necessary, direct them away from competing social movements? Every participant in the movement is a propagandist to the degree that he is able for there are few other functions and these depend on the movement’s ability to win response. If it fails, it must eventually deteriorate and either cease to carry on or function merely to satisfy the needs of its small and idiosyncratic membership. The content of ideational propaganda tends, by and large, to be abstract and moralistic: abstract, because it must establish a general framework of values before specific measures can be proposed; moralistic, because it must reach the inner springs of motivation and recruit a type of member who is “dedicated” in order to survive short-run failures and the lack of immediate tangible results.

At a more advanced stage of development (and this presupposes that the movement has increased in size, is more heterogeneous in composition and constitutes some threat to the status quo) the accent is pragmatic with the emphasis on political action. Activities connected with securing positions of power are now more important than propaganda which instead of being the responsibility of all may be delegated to particular persons. Moral absolutes are replaced by flexible principles so that those who hold or who are seeking power are not too rigidly bound in action and so that potential members who have been alienated by idealistic intransigence may be brought in.

The final stage, when success is regarded as imminent, is an administrative one. Only a token effort is made to convert non-believers. The major tasks are to stabilize the membership and to prepare for carrying out proposed changes.

Hyndman’s case seems to fall into a third and more sociological category of motivation: the need to structure adult experience with goals and the appropriate routines for achieving the goals when it has either been de-structured by some crisis or simply left unstructured by economic or social activity. This need may originate in childhood, but whether it becomes an active or latent and passive need depends on adult experience.

“Social movement” traditionally has been defined in a manner which would automatically exclude movements resisting social change. This has been the product of either explicitly or implicitly treating social movements as agencies seeking to bring about social change, often of a fundamental sort.

…
To narrow the concept of a social movement in this manner is to preclude an area of fruitful research and to close the door upon a good deal of the social dynamics in movement and \_ social change. In fact, the study of social movement within such a context becomes to a considerable degree sterile. Little more is involved than a struggle on the part of the reform effort to overcome cultural persistence. Very often there is more involved than the mere tenacity of culture. Movement frequently begets countermovement. Between the two a dynamic interrelation occurs.

Unfortunately, this looks like the theory chapter from his dissertation, but calls for folks to study the South and Klan (which he does in AJS).

At a more specific level, an effort is made to understand these changes in terms of a series of social movements. Four such movements are abstracted for analysis: (1) mass movement of populations; (2) adult education movement; (3) internal struggle for political power and representation; and (4) the movement toward American ideals in intergroup relations. The analysis points up the strength of the social movement concept as an appropriate tool for systematizing-for understanding and predicting-the changes which are under way in the southern region.},

Also the repudiation of 19th century evolutionary thought has tended to make suspect any directional, long range theorizing. A revitalization of social change analysis in the fullest develomental sense is required for the comprehension of change sequences and processes in the new nations.

Desire for racial integration was least prevalent among blacks who approved of the Muslims and among whites who rejected both civil-rights and nationalist organizations. These youth were also most likely to view racial identity as a source of status and achievement.

Employing data collected in lower-class urban slums of Santiago, Chile, it is found that neither socioeconomic status, nor mobility, rural-urban migration, subjective distance between aspirations and expectations, or a direct measure of subjective frustration have significant effects on leftist radical attitudes….n alternative definition is proposed here which envisions radicalism of the left not only as an emotional reaction but also as a relatively complex cognitive orientation, necessitating previous intellectual exposure and intervening processes for its emergence. The tenets of leftist extremism are not self-evident; therefore, the existence of frustration is no guarantee of acquisition of this political orientation.

If nothing else, this view points to the need of maintaining a clear conceptual separation between causation of major structural upheavals and the etiology of individual extremism. Blurring of the lines and uncritical extrapolation from one theoretical level to the other account, to a large extent, for the preservation of an empirically weak theory as a reflection, at the individual level, of structural processes and their frequently partial interpretations.

We analyze the effects of racial violence frequency and severity on changes between 1960 and 1970 in three socioeconomic variables: nonwhite income, unemployment rates, and the racial composition of selected occupations. These analyses are estimated separately for cities in the South and those in other regions. Our results consistently indicate no relationship between racial violence and black socioeconomic gains at the local level. These findings suggest that earlier evidence of reform responses to disorder in some cities may have reflected attempts to cool out black protest but did not result in substantive changes.

Litigation is one of several strategies available to social movements and their adversaries in the struggle for political power. After suggesting the potential and limits of social movement litigation, the paper examines political trials as one form of litigation, locating their origins in attempts to affect the distribution of resources important for the success of protest group efforts. Emphasis is placed on the jury and the press as two distinctive features of American democracy that affect decisions by social movement members to use the courts and also shape subsequent proceedings and outcomes. Finally, the paper discusses several lines of inquiry for future research.},

It included a status defense of the homemaker lifestyle, fueled by fears of declining prestige, and also protected class interests, since antisuffrage women were attempting to safeguard their own material privileges and prevent the proletarianization which paid employment represented. The theoretical implications of these findings for the study of social movements and gender stratification are also discussed.},

In two communities, recruitment was less likely to occur along the lines of established social networks. Instead, utilitarian alliances grounded on shared grievances were constructed. A second distinct path accounted for activism in two larger communities where many of the activists reported previous protest experience. In these communities, existing friendship networks were utilized. Two years after the accident, significant network and ideological differences between the groups persisted. We suggest that analysts work to specify the conditions for different paths to activism.},

In this paper, I study physician participation in a local anti-abortion campaign to trace the bases of such activity. While present community memberships appear to play a role, premedical college community plays no role. Further, while attitude variables appear to play some role, anti-abortion participants in the survey actually reject the Right-to-Life movement leadership's position on most of a series of movement-relevant issues. I interpret this finding in terms of Noelle-Neumann's concept of "the spiral of silence," which holds that the desire to avoid isolation leads to attitude incongruent activity, when such activity appears to have community sponsorship.},

It is argued that environmental opportunities and threats, including countermovement expansion, aided the mobilization and expansion of the movement after legalization of abortion. Weaknesses in the single-issue movement kept multi-issue SMOs involved in the face of threat. Interorganizational linkages and preexisting organization aided ongoing mobilization.

The results of empirical research have been inconclusive as well: some studies have found that repression deters protest, whereas others have found a positive (radicalizing) effect of repression on protest. This article proposes a model that explains the different effects of repression, in conjunction with other incentives, on political protest. We first hypothesize that repression has a direct negative (deterring) effect on protest because repression is a cost. This direct effect may be endorsed under some conditions, or it may be neutralized, or even reversed if repression leads to micromobilization processes that raise incentives for protest. These processes are set in motion if persons are exposed to repression, if repression is considered illegitimate by these persons and their social environment (which holds in case of legal protest), and if these persons are members of groups that support protest. Under such conditions repression indirectly increases protest by launching micromobilization processes. These processes and their effects are specified in a model which is tested and confirmed by a panel study of opponents of nuclear power in West Germany.},

Results show that performance in attaining program goals was not related to subsequent failure. However, the chapter officer's dependence on the central office for direction and the inability to engage successfully in cooperative action programs were related to failure. Chapters also demonstrated the need to attract a following of drunk-driving victims and others in the community to avoid failure. Results point to the importance of chapters developing their own independent activist agenda as part of the organizational adaptation that avoids failure. Two population characteristics of countries were controlled and failure was positively influenced by population size and negatively influenced by percentage college educated.},

We use the concepts of "cost" and "risk" to distinguish activist experiences within a single social movement. Data obtained from 141 participants in the sanctuary movement show: (1) individuals engage in a variety of movement activities; (2) cost and risk are empirically distinguishable, along with their personal correlates; and (3) of the variables drawn from two dominant explanations of movement participation, biographical availability factors best predict high-cost activism (more hours devoted to the movement), while socialization factors best differentiate high-risk (direct contact with Central American refugees) from low-risk activists (no refugee contact).},

Mathematical modeling

Specifically, we shall assume that power is a multiplicative function of two very general types of variables, total resources and the degree to which these resources are mobilized in the services of those persons or groups exercising the power.

 In general, we include under the heading of resources all factors relevant to the exercise of power which are ordinarily conceived as properties of the individual or group. We exclude variables with an obvious behavioral reference: factors such as leadership, intelligence, secrecy, and organization. It is hoped that the utility of this distinction will become apparent as we proceed.

 percentages. In a very real sense, the curve in Figure 1 can therefore be conceived as a threat curve. The power threat, in the form of a need for increasing degree of mobilization, may be relatively slight with small minority percentages, but the theory predicts that the threat should grow at a continually increasing rate. Unless the minority resources can be reduced to approximately zero under some such system as slavery, and unless My, can be kept extremely low, the need for a high degree of mobilization of resources in order to maintain dominance becomes extremely great as Negroes become numerous.

In the South:
Organizational effectiveness must be improved if the power advantage is to be sustained. Ideological systems will usually be developed (or revived) which explicitly call the nature of the minority threat to the attention of dominant group members. Deviants are more likely to be defined as traitors, and the more threatening stereotypes of the minority may be emphasized. Justifications for modifying the rules of fair play may be developed and, in extreme situations, the violent actions of organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan may be ignored or even justified. It becomes especially necessary to reduce the organizational strength of the opposing group through threats of violence, dividing its leadership, or offering compensatory inducements for subservience. The symbolic functions of segregation and other forms of discrimination become highly important.

The civil rights issue proved to be of central importance in the decisions of the Negro voters. The white voters, on the other hand, tended to make their decisions on other grounds, and the civil rights issue played a much lesser role. This was due not to indifference toward the issue but rather to the belief that the stands of Nixon and Kennedy were equally unacceptable. Thus Kennedy was able to attract a majority of Negro voters by adopting a somewhat more militant stance than his opponent on civil rights without alienating a large number of southern whites, who tended to regard any differences between the candidates on civil rights as insignificant.},

The writer, in the summer of 1962, examined the appeals records in 27 cases filed in the last 10 years in a Northeastern Federal manufacturing and repair center of 10,000 employees. Special attention was paid to the fact that 25 of 27 appellants were Negroes, most appeals involved failure to secure promotions, and only one appeal was decided in the appellants' favor. Analysis suggested that despite the official record of losses the procedure served the appellants in four ways: It provided a "day in court." It was a source of answers. It was a locus of hope. And it was an instrument of pressure. Similarly, the center found several uses for the procedure: It was a "safety valve." It was a spotlight on sources of friction. It was a device for correcting mis-impressions. And it was an effective check on the conduct of supervisory personnel. Overall, however, the writer concludes that the procedure is a limited tool with an essentially negative character. It must be supplemented by more positive measures if it is not to undo its own slim contribution to industrial race relations.},

Miraculously almost, realistic racial conflict with its ideological apparatus and action system functions to alleviate alienation and to facilitate identity. Conflict enhances group solidarity, clarifies group boundaries and strengthens the individual-group linkage through ego-emotion commitment and overt action. In-group identity is extended to the larger social system through the extension of communication, the enlargement of the network of social interactions and\_ ideological devotion to national core values. It may be said, then, that through realistic racial conflict America gains some new Americans.”

Moreover, (d) the member who views the union as a political as well as economic bargaining agency will tend to follow the union line (in voting intention and political orientation) more than a member who sees its function as “narrow.”

Retardation has been due to numerous forces, among them a structural and functional bias which in emphasizing the study of organizational adjustment to innovation has restricted the scope of change theory and research. Additionally, an emphasis upon cultural, as distinct from social, processes has obscured the interactional roots of change. Also the repudiation of 19th century evolutionary thought has tended to make suspect any directional, long range theorizing. A revitalization of social change analysis in the fullest develomental sense is required for the comprehension of change sequences and processes in the new nations. It is probable that our most feasible methodology for a "sociology of development" lies in the construction of a series of real models as refinements of the Gemeinschaft-Gesellschaft, Sacred-Secular theoretical tradition.},

The movement organization responds to the ebb and flow of sentiment in the larger society, to its relations with other movement organizations and to success or failure.

The dissertations may be classified into two decidedly different groups, those using a rather limited set of simple, descriptive categories of analysis, and those using an extensive set of rather elaborate, explanatory concepts.

Studies of social movements are quite frequently directed at the problem of sequence.”! About a third of the present group of dissertations consider this question. 
Social movements are sometimes viewed in terms of the process (sequence) of institutionalization. 

Generalizations about the “cause” of social movements reveal grounds which shift from one conceptual level of analysis to another: sometimes economic or psychological or social-psychological or diffusedly “sociological.” 

he variety of interpretations of the genesis of social movements*! reflects a characteristic aspect of social phenomena, the fact that they can be subsumed, even if not completely, under many formulas. he very inability, however, of the sociologist to develop a methodology or interpretive formula which can do justice to the richness of the phenomenal world is perhaps a commentary either (1) on the barrenness of his conceptual modes, or (2) on the immaturity of his scientific methodology, or (3) on the undefined character of his field of research.

The concepts of "adding" and "linkage" provided a way for taking a series of factors into account and for fusing them into a functional syndrome. The traditional racial structure is the initial and underlying factor. Against this background racial conflict could develop and become sociologically inevitable when four conditions were fulfilled. First, the group had to become adequately motivated for conflict, thus becoming a conflict group. Next, the conflict group had to discover and create available and usable resources of social power. Third, the prosecution of conflict required the development of organizational devices for mobilizing and focusing these power resources. And fourth, it was necessary to borrow or produce tactical devices for delivering social power in the process of collective struggle. When all these conditions were fulfilled, racial conflict was the only outcome that could be sociologically expected.},

The important question is, then, how can sociology make a contribution to the understanding of the maze of changes which are occurring in every sphere of life activity? Two basic assumptions, which at first may appear to be contradictory, form the general framework of the analysis: the stresses and strains toward change are taking place within the context of cultural continuity of the region; and the sectional south is disappearing-the new direction is the American way as an ideal. At a more specific level, an effort is made to understand these changes in terms of a series of social movements. Four such movements are abstracted for analysis: (1) mass movement of populations; (2) adult education movement; (3) internal struggle for political power and representation; and (4) the movement toward American ideals in intergroup relations. The analysis points up the strength of the social movement concept as an appropriate tool for systematizing-for understanding and predicting-the changes which are under way in the southern region.},

	abstract = {Radical-right campaigns commonly employ three discursive elements: anti-elite populism, exclusionary and declinist nationalism, and authoritarianism. Recent scholarship has explored whether these frames have diffused from radical-right to centrist parties in the latter?s effort to compete for the former?s voters. This study instead investigates whether similar frames had been used by mainstream political actors prior to their exploitation by the radical right (in the U.S., Donald Trump?s 2016 and 2020 campaigns). To do so, we identify instances of populism, nationalism (i.e., exclusionary and inclusive definitions of national symbolic boundaries and displays of low and high national pride), and authoritarianism in the speeches of Democratic and Republican presidential nominees between 1952 and 2020. These frames are subtle, infrequent, and polysemic, which makes their measurement difficult. We overcome this by leveraging the affordances of neural language models?in particular, a robustly optimized variant of bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (RoBERTa) and active learning. As we demonstrate, this approach is more effective for measuring discursive frames than other methods commonly used by social scientists. Our results suggest that what set Donald Trump?s campaign apart from those of mainstream presidential candidates was not the invention of a new form of politics, but the combination of negative evaluations of elites, low national pride, and authoritarianism?all of which had long been present among both parties?with an explicit evocation of exclusionary nationalism, which had been articulated only implicitly by prior presidential nominees. Radical-right discourse?at least at the presidential level in the United States?should therefore be characterized not as a break with the past but as an amplification and creative rearrangement of existing political-cultural tropes.},

we will deal with such questions involved in cohesiveness as: What holds the group together or, negatively, what keeps it from falling apart? How is consensus achieved within the group? What factors held to maintain membership, attendance, interest, and activity on the part of the participating individuals?

The observations made in this paper are admittedly subjective and unscientific in their nature. They are intended as hypotheses which are amenable to testing under the rapidly developing experimental laboratory techniques being used in sociology and social psychology.
The group observed here is a reform group with the explicit purpose of instigating social change in the local community. The authors actively participated in the group from its inception and were aware of and in touch with all of its various activities. 

Although this was an interest group, and that interest was explicitly known to all as the elimination of segregation in facilities serving the public in the local community, many of the participants were at opposite poles in terms of motivation, On the one hand were the ministers and church people who carried a conviction that segregation and discrimination are contrary to the doctrine of their churches. On the other hand there were the political “liberals” and those with no church affiliation who found logical contradictions between discrimination and democracy intolerable. 

This group had a distinct advantage in this respect because of its two criteria for membership mentioned earlier, which made the group so highly selective: persons who did not believe in taking direct action against the pattern of discrimination and persons who did not believe that such action must be non-violent could not bring themselves to join such a group. Thus there could be little argument in meetings concerning the efficacy of surveys, censuses, or “a slow process of education.” 

Even though the phrase “direct action” might sound somewhat amorphous, interested individuals were well aware of how it had been interpreted by similar groups in other cities. Certainly there remained alternatives from which the membership had to choose, e. g., sit-down strikes, boycotts, picket lines, or variations of these. But the fact that the alternatives were so narrowed served further to screen out those who were not in accord with the methods, however much they might be in accord with the goals.

 The first stage was the “test” described above. If the test was not successful in a particular instance, the group was to enter a “negotiation” stage involving discussions with the management of the establishment in question. If no arrangement could be worked out through these negotiations, then the third stage could be resorted to. This was the stage of “direct action”—picket, boycott, sit-down, or any other kind of action which would seem appropriate under the particular conditions.

A factor which seemed to take on great importance in keeping up the group’s morale was that there was always the feeling that “we haven’t yet exercised our full power.” If a test failed, negotiations might prove successful. If negotiations failed, direct action could always be undertaken. 

The initial practice of engaging in sociodramatic role-playing at meetings in rehearsal for tests and demonstrations can also be attributed to the social scientists in the group. Members played the parts of waitress, manager, customer, and the like.

Big Finish
The factors which made this a highly cohesive group and enabled it to arrive at consensus with a minimum of intragroup conflict seem to be of two general categories. The first may be termed organizational, and includes size, frequency of meetings, persistence of activities, employment of techniques of social science, and clearly defined methods and goals. The second category involves elements in the social-psychological dimension: the minimum of formal demands made upon the members, the altruistic motivation of the membership, the feeling of success, and the latent power potential.

Two basic assumptions, which at first may appear to be contradictory, form the general framework of the analysis: the stresses and strains toward change are taking place within the context of cultural continuity of the region; and the sectional south is disappearing-the new direction is the American way as an ideal. At a more specific level, an effort is made to understand these changes in terms of a series of social movements. Four such movements are abstracted for analysis: (1) mass movement of populations; (2) adult education movement; (3) internal struggle for political power and representation; and (4) the movement toward American ideals in intergroup relations. The analysis points up the strength of the social movement concept as an appropriate tool for systematizing-for understanding and predicting-the changes which are under way in the southern region.},

Also the repudiation of 19th century evolutionary thought has tended to make suspect any directional, long range theorizing. A revitalization of social change analysis in the fullest develomental sense is required for the comprehension of change sequences and processes in the new nations.

The present paper attempts to place this in the more general context of analyzing conditions which produce both social movements and revolutions. Three additional temporal hypotheses ("rising expectations," "relative deprivation," and "downward mobility") and one nontemporal hypothesis ("status inconsistency") are suggested. These five hypotheses are subsumed under the Theory of Cognitive Dissonance. This provides a general social psychological theory of motivation which could account for individual predispositions toward participation in social movements and revolutions. Predictions are made regarding the direction and intensity of such movements.},

This legitimacy-stability thesis implies that individuals with little confidence in the government would be particularly prone to support political protest. However, theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that this thesis must be revised to include a third, interacting factor-the preexistence of an organized protest movement: low confidence in the government is likely to translate into protest support only when such a movement is present. Using data from a 1972 national survey, only moderate associations are found between several indices of confidence in the government and support for political protest, and these associations are significantly reduced when salient structural factors (e.g., race, unemployment, community involvement) are taken into account. These results are not expected under the widely accepted, unrevised, legitimacy-stability thesis. However, consistent with a revised version of the thesis, it is found that low confidence in the government is strongly associated with protest support among those groups whose interests were being actively promoted by visible protest movements.},

We find strong support for the propositions that size of organization increases with system size and with extralocal affiliation, and evidence that organizations linked closely to the economic institution are larger. We show that large organizations are more stable in membership, and more centrally located in interorganization networks.

Legitimacy theory suggests that validity has direct effects on attempts to mobilize which are independent of propriety, power, and social control. A laboratory study is used to isolate these direct effects: when change in a communication network would damage collective purpose, fewer attempts at change are made. Further results reveal that validity also affects nonmobilizing alternatives. Moreover, validity indirectly influences propriety: individuals act out commitment to the constitutive rules and then bring propriety into line with that action. We conclude by noting implications of the structural effects of legitimacy on collective action.},

Weaknesses in the single-issue movement kept multi-issue SMOs involved in the face of threat. Interorganizational linkages and preexisting organization aided ongoing mobilization.

Using data on the founding and disbanding of national women's and minority organizations since 1955, I argue that Hannan and Freeman's (1989; Hannan \& Carroll 1992) theory of density-dependent legitimation and competition, and its extension to cross-effects among organizations, provides a framework for understanding the contemporary development of social change organizations. Though institutional and resource factors are important, they do not fully account for organizational vital rates. Findings indicate that increases in both service and protest organizations promoted the expansion of advocacy groups. As this middle-of-the-road strategy became more legitimate, competition became the predominant mode of interorganizational relationship. This accounts for the growth in the number of advocacy organizations after 1970, as well as the leveling off of service and protest organizations.},

In this article we extend Spilerman's 1971 analysis of community characteristics and race riots to include 1954-93. Our results parallel earlier ones that found little evidence that black poverty or racial disparities in income, education, and occupation caused race riots. Furthermore, we find that the effects of black poverty are generally opposite from what most deprivation theories would lead us to expect. Both low income for blacks and dilapidated housing significantly depress the rate of racial unrest. Finally, we find that competition that is expressed as the contraction of job opportunities for minorities created by demographic pressures and unemployment significantly increases the rate of race riots.},

They are found to be improving their position relative to whites in level of education and in holding middle status occupations but not upper status occupations. They are falling further behind whites in income. It seems likely that the proportion of status inconsistents among Negroes is increasing. The data are inconsistent with two of the derived hypotheses and are consistent with the other three. These latter hypotheses are reconciled in terms of a single common denominator: Changes in objective conditions cause feelings of relative deprivation, which, in turn, produce a tendency toward protest and rebellion.},

We show that these consensus views arise from selection on a contingent outcome variable: whether mobs intent on lynching succeed. We constructed an inventory of averted lynching events in Georgia, Mississippi, and North Carolina—instances in which lynch mobs formed but were thwarted, primarily by law enforcement. We combined these with an inventory of lynching and analyzed them together to model the dynamics of mob formation, success, and intervention. We found that low Republican vote share is associated with a higher lethality rate for mobs. Lynching is better understood as embedded in a post-conflict political system, wherein all potential lynching events, passing through the prism of intervention, are split into successful and averted cases.},

Few studies have attempted separate tests of the competition and power-threat hypotheses, and there is substantial, but generally overlooked, evidence that the effect of percent black on discrimination is limited to the South. Employing lynching rates of blacks in southern counties between 1889 and 1931 as the dependent variable, Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) and multiple regression analysis are used to test the power-threat hypothesis that minority concentration is positively related, with increasing slope, to level of discrimination. The hypothesis is supported in the total South, but separate analyses of the Lower (Deep) and Upper (Border) South reveal subregional variation with the predicted relationship found only in the Deep South. The study supports the proposition that the effect of minority percentage on discrimination is specific to particular cultural and/or socioeconomic contexts.},

The contextual model used in this analysis of official killing in 261 counties considers discriminatory executions a function of minority presence, urbanization, culture, and the availability of other forms of social control. The model explains a reasonable measure of the variation in discriminatory executions. It is environmental variables such as urbanization and minority presence that seem to play the largest role in generating discrimination in official killing. Future research might do well to investigate, as this effort did, the impact of variables on two dimensions of discrimination-its presence and its intensity where it is present. The results also argue for the use of models that include forms of social control that might substitute for, or serve as a complement to, the control mechanism under investigation.},

The thesis of this paper is that this theory needs severe modification. First, for an important class of organizations-organizations with goals unincorporated by the larger society or containing members with interests or values that are unincorporated-membership increases rather than inhibits participation. This is indicated both by a theoretical analysis of mass theory and by data gathered from participants in the Negro sit-in movement of the early 1960s. Second, this data indicates that the existence of many such organizations is necessary if a direct action movement is to be strong. Thus, not only routine, but disorderly politics too requires an organizational substructure to create and sustain it. Third, the data indicates that the substructures of these two types of politics are not totally distinct, but rather share certain organizations in common. Some organizations seem to generate participation in both types simultaneously, while others may, at one point in their history, inhibit participation, but at another, when a movement has gathered strength, generate it. In short, theory and data suggest the need for a major revision of mass theory which takes the variable of unincorporation into account.},

In this article, I present an event-history analysis of the disbanding of national women's and minority membership organizations between 1955 and 1985. Emphasis is on differences in organizational strategy, goals, and formal structure. I argue that properties promoting organizational legitimacy confer "survival advantages" by improving potential resource acquisition. The results suggest that membership groups that follow an accepted course of action based on moderate objectives and targeted to nonpolitical arenas are relatively secure. Moreover, there is no significant difference between women's and minority organizations. As in other organizational fields, survival chances are affected by liabilities of smallness, "adolescence," and "transformation."},

Critical factors in its decline are revealed as: sharp discontinuities in succession of personnel (faculty, student traits to be processed), absentee leadership and Trustees unable to give or respond to early warning signals, program innovations resisted by workers, or that workers were incompetent to execute, external programs that siphoned resources from the parent organization, and conditions in the social surround that contributed to disruption. The central orienting notion is that factors making for decline or death emerge at the intersection of an organization's legacy-its inherited purpose, procedures, and product-and influences that pour through its permeable boundary from its social and cultural environment.},

Using data on the founding and disbanding of national women's and minority organizations since 1955, I argue that Hannan and Freeman's (1989; Hannan \& Carroll 1992) theory of density-dependent legitimation and competition, and its extension to cross-effects among organizations, provides a framework for understanding the contemporary development of social change organizations. Though institutional and resource factors are important, they do not fully account for organizational vital rates. Findings indicate that increases in both service and protest organizations promoted the expansion of advocacy groups. As this middle-of-the-road strategy became more legitimate, competition became the predominant mode of interorganizational relationship. This accounts for the growth in the number of advocacy organizations after 1970, as well as the leveling off of service and protest organizations.},

This article shows how diffusion theory helps us to better understand this process by specifying ways in which social movement organizations within the same movement may influence one another through indirect network ties. More specifically, I show that a new tactic of protest, the shantytown, spread rapidly among U.S. campuses between 1985 and 1990. Recent advances in the modeling of diffusion in an event history framework allow me to test for the diffusion of this innovative strategy of protest among certain groupings of colleges and universities. Specifically, my results indicate that the tactic spread among colleges and universities with similar size endowments, of roughly the same level of prestige, and of the same institutional type. My analysis also indicates that high prestige, liberal arts colleges with smaller numbers of African American students had higher rates of shantytown protest.},

The same variables were employed to discriminate between groups engaged in active or passive opposition to the incident and those who displayed active or passive support. A multiple discriminant function analysis revealed that ideological position (whether one perceives himself as a conservative, "middle-of-the- roader," liberal, or radical) and attachment to and satisfaction with the University were the two variables that discriminated most strongly between the two polar attitudinal groups and also between the groups who, by their actions, either opposed or supported the incident.},

The results of this exploratory effort suggest that former student activists ten years after leaving college are truly marching to a different drummer. Occupationally they are heavily concentrated in the knowledge and human service occupations, while the former student government members and the noninvolved are concentrated in the private sector of the economy. 
Politically, activists participate in institutional and noninstitutional politics, with a distinctive orientation setting them apart from the other two groups. The activists identify themselves almost exclusively as radicals and liberals while the other groups are moderates and conservatives.

The argument is advanced that educational competence rather than educational facilities is a more appropriate measure of opportunity. It is suggested that strategies for remediation must focus on desegregation, on the reprofessionalization of teachers, on creating a sense of efficacy in students, and on reducing the influence of educationally impoverished homes. There is a discussion of authenticity as an issue for white southerners and for Negroes, and a concluding section discusses current tensions between scholarly analysis and social action in the conduct of sociologists.},

The central argument is that rates of racial violence rose when interracial competition increased. This increase was due primarily to black migration to southern manufacturing areas, black participation in the cotton economy, and the rise of black participation in the Populist movement. To address more fully the political facet of interracial competition, we first analyze the forces leading to the Populist movement. We find that black counties and counties with a higher degree of farm tenancy were more likely to have supported Populist candidates, and that manufacturing counties were less likely to vote Populist. When we analyze the causes of lynching, we find that lynching rates increased when economic competition increased, but that counties that voted Populist did not have significantly higher rates of black lynching.},

Three generic types of disputes are identified and elaborated: diagnostic, prognostic, and frame resonance disputes. Of the 51 disputes observed, all but two involved SMOs from two or more different movement factions. More disputes occurred between the movement's most moderate and radical factions than between other factions. Intramural conflicts were both detrimental and facilitative of the disarmament movement and its SMOs.},

This historical study begins to fill this void by analyzing the contestation between employers and labor movement actors in relation to two critical right-to-work campaigns in the industrial Midwest in the 1950s. I find that actors who balance formal, professionalized organization with a more localized presence on the ground are in a better position to pursue multiple mechanisms of influence and to shape policy, while internal divisions severely limit their prospects. Event structure analyses of right-to-work campaigns advance this discussion, revealing how social movement organizational characteristics matter to the extent that they enable opposing movements to counter each others actions in unfolding political processes.

	abstract = {Gaining attention in the mass media is a key goal of many social movement organizations (SMOs). The dominant explanation of media attention to SMOs is that the media act like a filter, selecting some types of SMOs and events for attention, and ignoring others based on characteristics of these SMOs, events, and their political environment. In contrast to this “bias model,” I argue that some media attention to SMOs is characterized by positive feedback, or rich-get-richer processes: past media attention increases the likelihood of future media attention through its effect on the SMO and on other media outlets. Like other positive feedback systems, media attention can be path dependent, is routinely punctuated by large cascades of attention to previously obscure SMOs, and can be contingent on “accidents” of history: at critical junctures, individuals, organizations, and events have the potential to radically impact the extent of media attention to their movements and organizations. Media attention to SMOs can also become decoupled from the types of events that initially sparked their media attention, becoming spokes-organizations for their movements and receiving media attention for events and stories that they themselves are not involved. In support of this theory, I first show that media attention is, similar to other positive feedback processes, power-law distributed across SMOs using two national (US) data sets. I then illustrate the process of positive feedback in media attention through a case study of the Black Panther Party's rise to prominence in media attention.},

My answer to the query follows a movement-centered production and circulation of culture template organized around several major moments of culture moves: moving across space, moving emotions, moving social-cultural conditions and moving through memory.

Consistent with expectations, results suggest union presence and worker solidarity, in and of themselves, have little meaningful association with strikes.

We leverage survey experiments—largely the domain of political scientists and public opinion researchers—to examine how much human/citizenship rights, economics, and family framing contests shape Californians' views about legalization and immigrants' access to public benefits. We pay particular attention to how potentially distinct “publics,” or subgroups, react, finding significant differences in frame resonance between groups distinguished by political ideology. However, alternative framings resonate with—at best—one political subgroup and, dauntingly, frames that resonate with one group sometimes alienate others. While activists and political theorists may hope that human rights appeals can expand American notions of membership, such a frame does not help the movement build support for legalization. Instead, the most expansive change in legalization attitudes occurs when framed as about family unity, but this holds only among self-reported conservatives. These findings underscore the challenges confronting the immigrant movement and the need to reevaluate the assumption that historically progressive rights language is effective for immigrant claims-making.},

Our analysis of black civil rights organizations shows that goal and tactical diversity of a social movement is largely a function of organizational density, level of resources available to the movement, and the number of protests initiated by the movement. Goal diversity increases the rate of protest, whereas tactical diversity increases the likelihood of achieving a desired policy outcome. These findings advance our understanding of social movements and organizations by illuminating how organizational dynamics of a social movement might change over time, and in turn how this change might affect the vitality and desired outcomes of social movements.},

Yet we find evidence of homeless protest events across no fewer than 50 U.S. cities in the 1980–90 period. Drawing on social movement theories about the precipitants of mobilization, we examine the extent to which city-level contextual factors, and their change over time, affect variation in the frequency of homeless mobilization across 17 of these cities. Our findings reveal that a mix of factors congruent with strain and resource mobilization theories helps to account for variation in the frequency of homeless protest across U.S. cities in the 1980s.},

Yet though the lynching of blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole. This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930. Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the analysis of discrete incidents.},

We apply the theory to a study of state-level woman suffrage legislation. We find that legislators responded to suffragists by bringing the issue of woman suffrage to the legislative forum, but once suffrage bills reached the voting stage, differences in social movement tactics and organization did not have as great an impact.},

An event-history analysis reveals that organizational readiness and political opportunities had little to do with change in the suffragists' strategic approach. Rather, the change occurred when movements consisted of a diverse assortment of organizations, when movement organizations were less centrally structured, when conflict existed among movement members, when movements engaged in fundraising, and when the suffragists had recently experienced significant political defeat. The model of tactical change presented here better explains the impetuses for such a shift than do earlier explanations.},

I provide an analytic history of civil-rights and school-desegregation conflicts in Mississippi, and I use OLS models to examine county-level variation in local support for private academies during this period. My analysis shows that the formation of academies occurs as a response to desegregation (1) when there is a credible threat that desegregation will be implemented (implicitly signaling the “success” of the movement); (2) when blacks have the organizational capacity to make claims and voice protest within newly desegregated schools; and (3) when whites have the organizational capacity to resist desegregation. These three specifications extend models of racial competition that have been used to explain white countermobilization. I argue that the establishment of academies was a countermovement strategy that flowed out of the prior history of organized white resistance to the civil-rights movement. In other words, whites were not only responding to court intervention and the proportion of African Americans in their community, but to the social movement mobilization of that community.},

Drawing from prior sociological work that has examined this medium and its uses by white supremacist organizations, this article advances the understanding of recruitment, identity and action by providing a synthesis of interpretive and more systematic analyses of thematic content, structure and associations within white supremacist discourse. Analyses, which rely on TextAnalyst, highlight semantic networks of thematic content from principal white supremacist websites, and delineate patterns and thematic associations relative to the three requisites of social movement culture denoted in recent research — namely identity, interpretational framing of cause and effect, and political efficacy. Our results suggest that nationalism, religion and definitions of responsible citizenship are interwoven with race to create a sense of collective identity for these groups, their members and potential recruits. Moreover, interpretative frameworks that simultaneously identify threatening social issues and provide corresponding recommendations for social action are employed. Importantly, and relative to prior work, results show how the interpretation of problems, their alleged causes and the call to action are systematically linked. We conclude by discussing the framing of white supremacy issues, the organizations' potential for recruitment, and how a relatively new communication medium, the Internet, has been cheaply and efficiently integrated into the white supremacist repertoire. Broader implications for social movement theory are also explored.},

	abstract = {Social movements often seek to draw attention to issues they deem important by organizing public demonstrations with the aim of attracting mass media coverage. But only a small proportion of all public demonstrations receives any media attention. This article asks whether even the minimal coverage that demonstrations receive reveal any influence of social movements in shaping how issues are framed by the mass media. Analyzing newspaper and television news stories on Washington, D.C. protests held during 1982 and 1991, we ask whether news reports on protests are framed in ways consistent with the aims of protesters. Do demonstrators receive media coverage that highlights the issues about which they are concerned, or does coverage focus on the protest event itself, to the exclusion of the social issues that movements target? Our results support much of the surmising among media scholars, that even when movements succeed at obtaining the attention of mass media outlets, media reports portray protests in ways that may undermine social movement agendas. Despite this obstacle to communicating protest messages through demonstrations, movements engage in other forms of communication that can affect public interpretations of mass media frames.},

Results from multivariate analyses of civil rights protest, organizational formation, and policy outcomes indicate significant variation depending on (1) whether the political opportunity structure is conceptualized broadly or narrowly, (2) the dependent variable concerned, and (3) the underlying assumptions about the mechanisms through which opportunities translate into action. We argue that the variation in results can best be understood by adopting a broader understanding of protest and the political process and that theory development requires more careful and more explicit — although not necessarily more uniform — conceptualization and specification of political opportunity variables and models.},

The source of data is articles published in major sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of organizations on policy The major findings include: political organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.},

Despite strong theory suggesting the importance of ideology, it has not found support in previous cross-national statistical studies. But ideology has not been as well measured as structural and political factors. In this article, we demonstrate that gender ideology strongly affects the number of women in national legislatures. We do so by introducing a newly available measure of national gender ideology into a cross-national model of women in legislatures.

The fundamental hypothesis is that rates of racial violence rose when interracial competition intensified because of immigration, urbanization of blacks, economic contractions, and political challenges to white supremacy in the South. Event-history and time-series analyses show that economic slumps, particularly those that affected the least-skilled workers, increased rates of both lynching and urban racial violence, as did rising competition from immigration. Lynching also appears to have been sensitive to factors affecting the Southern region directly. In particular, lynching was affected by Populist challenges to one-party rule as well as by changing fortunes of the cotton economy. Results suggest that theories that take both political and economic dimensions of competition into account at the same time hold promise for explaining diverse forms of racial violence.},

Using data on the founding and disbanding of national women's and minority organizations since 1955, I argue that Hannan and Freeman's (1989; Hannan \& Carroll 1992) theory of density-dependent legitimation and competition, and its extension to cross-effects among organizations, provides a framework for understanding the contemporary development of social change organizations. Though institutional and resource factors are important, they do not fully account for organizational vital rates. Findings indicate that increases in both service and protest organizations promoted the expansion of advocacy groups. As this middle-of-the-road strategy became more legitimate, competition became the predominant mode of interorganizational relationship. This accounts for the growth in the number of advocacy organizations after 1970, as well as the leveling off of service and protest organizations.},

Using data from the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, we show how demonstrators differed from nonactivists in two time periods: shortly after their movement experiences in 1973; and when they were in their mid-thirties in 1982. Controlling for the factors that predict becoming a protester, we explore the influence of activism on: (1) politics; (2) status attainment; (3) religion; and (4) family. We find that controlling for factors that predict protest participation, these typical activists are significantly different from their nonactivist counterparts. Specifically, former protesters hold more liberal political orientations and are more aligned with liberal parties and actions; select occupations in the "new class"; are more educated; hold less traditional religious orientations and are less attached to religious organizations; marry later; and are less likely to have children.},

The relatively spontaneous, peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective action. While both structurally oriented and identity-oriented theory offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants. Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution possible once the state began to founder.},

	abstract = {This article traces the development of student activists among members of the high school class of 1965. We explore how political and religious socialization, social psychological orientations, and class origins affect the likelihood that an individual will become involved in the antiwar, student, and civil rights protests of the 1960s. We also systematically examine the interrelationships between social class, gender, social psychological orientations, and political and religious socialization to discern their effects on social movement participation. Using data from the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, 1965–73, we find that socialization processes and social psychological dispositions are strongly linked to participation in the protests and that social class spurs protest both directly and through its effects on these factors. We also find that gender differences in social movement participation are largely a function of socialization, social psychological differences, and women's lower rates of college attendance.},

It argues that the Klan's rise is best understood as a response to the sudden devaluation in the economic and political "purchasing power" of the Klan's recruits. Guided by microeconomic logic, the Klan used cultural appeals to stimulate demand for what its members had to offer in exchange within economic and political markets. It also used cultural attacks to restrict the supply of competitors.

This paper reexamines the empirical support for a power threat interpretation of southern lynchings and finds it wanting. It is shown that previous analyses have been plagued by a variety of conceptual and methodological weaknesses including: sensitivity to extremely influential cases; sample selection truncation; an inappropriate measure of lynching; and possible model misspecification. Our alternative analyses, including corrections for these problems, reveal no support for the power threat explanation for lynching.},

In our conceptualization, protest events play the role of network nodes and links were identified based on protesters citing prior events as sources of inspiration for mobilizing. Appropriating strategies for network analysis, we assess the types of events that were more likely to be cited as sources of inspiration and bridge otherwise disconnected events. Our analysis shows that protests that raised systemic versus local issues and events that were repressed by the state were more likely to occupy central positions in the democracy movement. By identifying the characteristics of events that contribute to movement inspiration and bridging, our novel approach to analyzing protest events sheds new light on dominant themes in social movement research.},

Scholars thus question the contemporary relevance of organized labor to social policy. Yet, there is considerable state-level variation in social policy and union institutional strength that remains underexamined. Focusing on variability across US states, this paper uses mixed-methods analysis to examine relationships between organized labor and parental and family leave legislation under varying political conditions. Event history analysis of state-level leave policy adoption from 1983 to 2016 shows that union institutional strength, particularly in the public sector, is positively associated with the timing of leave policy adoption. These findings are robust to the inclusion of other factors, including Democratic control of state houses, which is also shown to facilitate leave policy adoption. Comparative case studies support event history findings and illustrate how state house partisanship informs the level of government that leave advocates target for policy change. The paper concludes by suggesting further attention to subnational policies and investigation into the social movement practice of target-shifting and its effects. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates the operation of power resources at the subnational level within a liberal market national context.},

We study the refugee solidarity movement in a mixed methods design employing online ethnography, survey, and “big” social media data. Instead of conceptualizing the group as a social network or social movement organization (SMO), we argue that the group’s culture emerges as patterns of interaction that have implications for what kind of activities in which group members participate. Based on observations from our online ethnography, we suggest that group interaction influences differential individual participation through processes of (1) encoding different habits and (2) attuning the activist to different aspects of situations. We support our theoretical propositions with six statistical tests of the relationship between the group-level variable of contentious group style and the individual-level variable of participation in political protest. The dependent variable, political protest, and a comprehensive set of controls stem from an original survey of the Danish refugee solidarity movement with 2,283 respondents. We link the survey data with “big” social media data used to estimate the focal explanatory variable, contentious group style, generated from content analysis of online interaction in 119 Facebook groups quantified with supervised machine learning. The results show that group style has a consistently positive relationship with the individual’s degree of participation independent of networks, SMO framing, and individual attributes.},

This article does so focusing on direct social action, that is, a form of collective action that does not primarily focus upon claiming something from the state but instead focuses upon directly transforming some specific aspects of society. Building on conceptual categories developed by social movements’ scholars (context, organization, and identity) and relying on rich qualitative and quantitative data from collective actors in Italy in a time of crisis, this article identifies four paths toward direct social actions (DSA): the social path, the political-social path, the social-political path, and the political path. In doing so, our analysis shifts from the search for causal factors to the reconstruction of the dynamic, patterned sequences of events by which collective actors progress in adopting a certain form of action. The implications of these findings extend beyond studies of DSA in times of crisis in Italy, to an analysis of collective action in general. Capturing these multiple paths also has important implications for understanding how the same form of action is differently implemented and received when it is adopted by different actors.},

	abstract = {We employ a unique sample of participants in the early 1960s Nashville civil rights movement to examine within-movement micromobilization processes. Rather than assuming movement micromobilization and participation is internally homogeneous, we extend the literature by identifying distinct types of pathways (entry and preparation) and distinct types (or modes) of movement participation. Pathways into the Nashville movement are largely structured a priori by race, by several distinct points of entry (politically pulled, directly recruited, or professionally pushed), and by prior experience or training in nonviolent direct action. Participation falls into a distinct division of movement labor characterized by several major modes of participation—core cadre, soldiers, and supporters. We demonstrate that pathways and modes of participation are systematically linked and that qualitatively distinct pathways contribute to understanding qualitative modes of movement participation. Specifically, all core cadre members were pulled into activism, soldiers were either pulled or recruited, and supporters were pulled, recruited, or pushed. Highly organized, disciplined, and intense workshop training proved to be integral in becoming a member of the core cadre but not for soldier or supporter roles. We conclude that social movement studies would do well to pay more attention to variability in structured pathways to, preparation for, and qualitative dimensions of movement participation. These dimensions are critical to further understanding the way movements and their participants move and add insights regarding an important chapter in the southern civil rights movement. The implications of our findings extend to modes of movement activism more generally.},

However, few have systematically explained the conditions that facilitate diaspora movements’ “voice” after “exit” across cases or over time. The article addresses this shortcoming by explaining how and to what extent diaspora movements became auxiliary forces for anti-regime rebellions during the Arab Spring. Using data that include 239 original interviews on Libyan, Syrian, and Yemeni mobilization from the US and Great Britain, the analysis finds that only some diaspora groups played a sustained, full-spectrum role in their home-country’s rebellion by broadcasting their allies’ claims, remitting resources homeward, representing the rebellion to external audiences, brokering between parties, and volunteering on the front lines. The article then demonstrates how differences in (1) the rebellion’s needs, (2) geopolitical support, (3) activist resources, and (4) access to the front lines produced variation in auxiliary activism by national group, host-country, and over time. In so doing, the article contributes to theories of transnationalism, social movements, diaspora politics, and cross-border contentious politics more generally.},

Adjudicating this debate is important for pragmatic and theoretical reasons. Pragmatically, these divergent characterizations suggest different barriers climate discourse might pose for engaging public concern and citizen mobilization. Theoretically, these characterizations provide different understandings of how elites respond to structural crisis. Using automated text analysis to describe a large corpus of organizations’ press releases about climate change from 1985 to 2013 (N = 1,768), I find that this discourse has been largely expert-oriented and technocratic, neglecting concerns of values and identity widely believed to be important for social movement mobilization. Organizations predominantly frame climate change as a problem that, while real and serious, is best handled through the careful and deliberate work of scientific, political, and economic elites. Surprisingly, these observations remain true even among advocacy organizations. These findings provide empirical support that a “post-political” framing of climate change, where the issue is discussed in a way that neutralizes social and political power dynamics, dominates American organizations’ official pronouncements about climate change. To the extent that earlier scholars are correct that conflict-oriented discursive strategies—such as identification of a common antagonist—are effective at rousing public concern, this discourse is unlikely to mobilize strong public emotion and activism.},

The analysis reveals the existence of six movement logics of varying breadth, flexibility, and stability. We also detect two important shifts in the overall structure of the field, one toward a broad and flexible form of state-centric politics and one toward several differentiated and narrowly defined forms of nonpolitical contention. We find support for two key premises of the institutional movement logics framework, limited diversity, and relative stability within and between logics while showing that a longer time frame offers a window on field dynamics not visible with shorter study time frames.

Missing is an assessment of how evangelical-infused understandings of national belonging shape the views of people outside the white evangelical subculture. We analyze how Americans of all religious backgrounds evaluate a secularized evangelical discourse (SED)—a repertoire of political statements that are phrased in religiously nonparticularistic terms, but have roots in evangelical Christian history and epistemologies and have been politicized through social movements and party politics. Using latent class analysis and nationally representative survey data, we identify four prevailing profiles of support for claims about public religious expression anchored in this repertoire: ardent opposition, moderate opposition, moderate support, and ardent support. We find that a majority of Americans, not just evangelicals, respond positively to propositions that employ SED. Consequently, we argue that conservative Christianity influences contemporary politics not only by furnishing individuals with beliefs and identities, but also by providing a durable and flexible source of boundaries around a culturally specific vision of national belonging that resonates far beyond the boundaries of the evangelical subculture.},

This study analyzes frame variation of the most deleterious child protectionist claims about stranger danger, assertions that the presence of racial, gender, and sexual others in public spaces will harm children. This paper is a content analysis of political flyers and messages developed by Religious Right campaigns at the state and municipal level between 1974 and 2013; these campaigns framed gay men and transgender woman as threats to children in classrooms and bathrooms. For both gay men and transgender women, these claims were most common at the start of rights advocacy. I argue that challengers make the most overt, deleterious arguments about harm to children when new groups initially advocate for legal rights and access to new spaces; as marginalized groups become more familiar and less “strange,” challengers make more covert claims about these groups, as stranger danger claims have waning cultural and political resonance.},

The paper investigates the role of the urban environment in shaping grievances expressed and mobilization/counter-mobilization processes observed during a riotous episode. In particular, I look at large social-housing estates as a propitious urban setting for the eruption and sustenance of anti-state violence. I identify three mechanisms (stigma amplification and inversion, failure of state intervention in the form of everyday administration and emergency policing, and advantages for network activation and resource mobilization among potential rioters) that complement standard explanations of rioting based on socioeconomic and ethno-cultural grievances. I test the theoretical model using a controlled case study of two neighboring suburbs in the North of Paris, with similar socioeconomic, demographic, and political characteristics but different violent outcomes in the 2005 nation-wide wave of French riots. The paper traces the source of local variation to the exogenous presence of large, concentrated social-housing estates in one, but not the other. The analysis here treats anti-state rioting as a form of urban protest and looks at state-society divisions rooted in urban geography and policy that have been overlooked in conventional scholarship on minority mobilization in Europe.},

	abstract = {This article proposes a theory of how interaction in groups influences differential participation in political activism and interrogates this theory through an empirical analysis of online Facebook group interaction. We study the refugee solidarity movement in a mixed methods design employing online ethnography, survey, and “big” social media data. Instead of conceptualizing the group as a social network or social movement organization (SMO), we argue that the group’s culture emerges as patterns of interaction that have implications for what kind of activities in which group members participate. Based on observations from our online ethnography, we suggest that group interaction influences differential individual participation through processes of (1) encoding different habits and (2) attuning the activist to different aspects of situations. We support our theoretical propositions with six statistical tests of the relationship between the group-level variable of contentious group style and the individual-level variable of participation in political protest. The dependent variable, political protest, and a comprehensive set of controls stem from an original survey of the Danish refugee solidarity movement with 2,283 respondents. We link the survey data with “big” social media data used to estimate the focal explanatory variable, contentious group style, generated from content analysis of online interaction in 119 Facebook groups quantified with supervised machine learning. The results show that group style has a consistently positive relationship with the individual’s degree of participation independent of networks, SMO framing, and individual attributes.},

	abstract = {This article examines the rapid transformations in the salience of sectarian boundaries despite seemingly deeply entrenched polarization. Lebanon provides an interesting case study where sectarian dichotomies moved relatively quickly from a predominantly “Christian–Muslim” divide to a more recent “Sunni–Shia” split within the context of tumultuous street mobilizations. While this sectarian dichotomy is resonant with the regional intra-Muslim divide, its local dynamics and mechanisms remain unknown. Based on recent literature pointing to street mobilization as an important channel for ethnic politics, this article focuses on co-mobilization—or coalition formation in protests—as a mechanism of sectarianization. It builds on an original and exclusive protest event catalogue (2000–2010), network analysis, and in-depth interview to ask: how does the salience of sectarian dichotomies shift in tandem with transformations in street politics? Through an analysis of momentous street mobilizations and coalition formations, the article traces how sectarian and political fault-lines are (re-)drawn and crystalized. The findings suggest that sectarian polarization emerges when political parties (re-)alignments overlap with the boundaries of sectarian cleavages, thus allowing interchangeability between political and sectarian categories. Contrary to common belief, this finding indicates that intra-sectarian political unity—rather than inter-sectarian divisions—shapes the processes of sectarianization and polarization.},

I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.},

	abstract = {This study uses insider ethnographic and interview data to examine one of the largest sustained collective actions in the history of the United States—the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011. It finds that this event took a highly unusual form due to a social relation that I term escalating moral obligation, a sense of solidaristic duty that grows increasingly fervent as others struggle on behalf of a shared cause. Each of three active groups within the movement engaged in arduous and unconventional resistance to controversial legislation, and did so in a manner that induced moral debt among the other groups. Fervency of commitment to the cause increased as a result of allies taking risky or self-sacrificial actions. Each group felt obligated to continue difficult mobilization as long as others continued theirs. Escalating moral obligation develops a simultaneously emergent, endogenous, and cognitive dimension of social movements. It is a relational mechanism linking political opportunity with actual mobilization. The political opportunity in this case was a combination of several conditions: an elite cleavage over the desirability of public unions, a more local balance of power allowing dissident legislators to obstruct but not defeat legislation, and an immediate severe popular reaction. This mechanism is potentially generalizable to other risky or arduous protests. When activists are motivated by the sacrifice or risk-taking of allied activists, escalating moral obligation is present. The concept links group-level imperatives with individual-level motivations. Escalating moral obligation shows one way that individual subjectivities can change through group interrelations and emotionally intense interactions.},

	abstract = {Despite efforts by protesters to develop newsworthy tactics, there is ample evidence that reporters use a few well-defined scripts to construct stories on these events. The institutionalization of protest has only served to amplify the routinization of media coverage. How then do reporters address emergent forms of collective action that fail to conform to existing scripts? The current research investigates this phenomenon by comparing the language used to describe protest in major American cities and disturbances on college and university campuses. Colleges and universities have seen an upsurge of these events, such as disorderly celebrations following sporting contests. In contrast, protest has become increasingly institutionalized. As a consequence, we suspected that coverage of campus community disturbances would draw much more heavily on language that portrays them as dangerous than would coverage of protests. Our analysis of newspaper coverage reveals that even when taking into consideration important event features like the behaviors of police and civilians, protests are covered in a far more routine fashion than are campus community riots, a condition that holds even for the most contentious protest events. These findings provide important insights into the interplay of collective action and media attention, and are especially timely given the recent rise of more contentious events such as the \#blacklivesmatter protests.},

Using survey data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 2,093) and semi-structured interviews from the National Study of Youth and Religion (N = 46), we test for and explain differences in the college selectivity of students from conservative Protestant (CP) religious backgrounds compared to others. We hypothesize that CPs attend less selective colleges than other young adults, and that this may especially be the case among women. Our quantitative findings suggest CPs do attend less selective colleges, and the difference is greater among those with better high school GPAs. However, these differences are nonexistent for men once background factors are controlled. CP women attend less selective colleges than other women—a difference that is even larger among women with higher academic ability. Our qualitative findings suggest that these differences stem from young women’s different understandings of the purposes of college (general self-betterment versus human capital investment), which relate to unique strategies for balancing work and family, enacting altruism, and achieving self-satisfaction. These findings show the continued link between religion and stratification and, more broadly, culture and stratification.},

Based on an original dataset, we analyze more than 10,000 protest events that took place in Turkey between 2000 and 2009. Our findings suggest that compared to others, pro-Kurdish events are more likely to encounter police action, one that particularly involves repressive strategies. We further show that repressive policing in pro-Kurdish events is more pronounced when the Kurdish armed insurgency against the state intensifies. Given that this is the first systematic quantitative study on protest policing in Turkey, it not only tests previously confirmed theories of protest policing, but also makes a theoretical contribution by providing a dynamic notion of threat beyond its situational forms, which builds on the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK.},

The relationship, however, is mediated by the issue agenda of mass media more generally, attesting to an indirect rather than a direct effect. Additionally, the effect of media-covered protests on the general media agenda is moderated by the political system and is larger in majoritarian countries than in countries with a consensus democracy.

We complement past work that suggests that forces of professionalization and counterpressure alter activists' tendency to use violent and disruptive tactics. With data on over 23,000 protest events in the United States between 1960 and 1995, we find that protest events characterized by broadly resonating claims are more likely to employ tactics that are disruptive but nonviolent. By contrast, events espousing narrower claims are more likely to employ disruptive tactics that are also violent. Moreover, when governmental entities are targeted, protests are less likely to witness the use of both violent and nonviolent disruptive tactics. We discuss the implications of our results for social movement theory and the dynamics of collective violence.},

This is a crucial but poorly understood aspect of social movements. While most prior research has focused on the personal determinants of attitudes toward movements, we argue that proximity to protest may cultivate positive views about a movement. Individuals living near centers of movement activity may become more favorable to protest because they become more sympathetic to the demands of activists. We investigate public support about protest tactics among white Southerners during the early stages of the civil rights movement. To do so, we employ a representative survey conducted in 1961 with nearly 700 white adults living in the South. These survey data are combined with contextual data measuring local protest, political behavior, and civic organizations. Most scholars have focused on the ways that civil rights activity propelled white counter-mobilization, but protest also won sympathy from a small subset of white Southerners, thereby fracturing the dominant consensus in support of Jim Crow segregation. We also find that local racial political context matters: individuals living in counties with weaker support for segregationist politics, where white moderates were active, and outside the Deep South were generally more favorable. At the individual level, our strongest findings indicate that sit-in support was more likely from those with greater educational attainment, less frequent church attendance, and exposure to discussions about race relations from the pulpit.},

Whereas most social movement literature has addressed this question in the US context for policy change outcomes, this paper takes a different approach by bringing the question to a global context and examines democratization as a structural outcome. Accordingly, we test several hypotheses about the ephemeral, positive, and negative influences of contentious collective action on the democratization process in a given country, as well as the cross-border effect of the contention. To go beyond the limitations of previous studies, this paper uses a monthly time-series, cross-national model to examine potential liberalizing or deliberalizing effects of protest activities. Using data from 103 non-democratic countries from 1990 to 2004, we find that protests and riots increase the probability that a country will liberalize in a given month. We find that while contentious events in other countries do not directly increase the risk of liberalization, external contentious events, especially those that lead to political liberalization, increase the count of contentious events, thus indirectly boosting liberalization. We find no evidence that protest significantly increases the chances of deliberalization. Together, our findings show a key role for non-elite political actors to influence political liberalization.},

Our analysis of protest in North Bohemia provides insight into broader patterns of elite legitimacy and resistance. Our findings show that the environmental externalities stemming from state-mandated production in the North Bohemian region posed an imminent threat that spurred residents to protest despite harsh state repression.

	abstract = {Using terms like free spaces and havens, conventional wisdom views social ties by subordinate groups to dominant group members as hindering protest participation. In contrast, we draw on ethnic resiliency and social capital perspectives and argue that there are mobilization benefits to having dominant group members as friends. We offer a unique statistical test by examining the effect of white social ties on Mexican American participation in cultural and political protest. Using survey data, bivariate and multivariate results demonstrate that social connections to whites promote Mexican American activism. We conclude with a discussion of how our findings can be reconciled with previous scholarship.},

Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.},

Much research has theorized on how digital networks transmit mobilizing content, fewer studies examine the structure of online networks, and even fewer test how the structure of online networks affects participation for political behaviors with differing costs. From a structural network perspective, I highlight the puzzle: If according to recent literature, digital networks are loose with many weak ties, how can such a network configuration facilitate high-cost political behavior that requires multiple social reinforcements? I map the following relationships among 655 Twitter users who follow the Black Lives Matter Sacramento chapter and compare the structure of the digital network to three commonly observed ideal type networks. The results show that the digital network is structurally distinct from the ideal types, as it is characterized by an extremely dense cluster but also with many loosely connected components, which I describe as a “cluster-connective network.” Results from computer experiments further show that paradoxically, this “cluster-connective” configuration benefits participation for high-cost behavior but hinders participation for low-cost behavior. The results illustrate how a structural network perspective helps scholars move from the question of whether digital networks facilitate participation to the conditions under which digital networks encourage participation.},

We uncover a wide diversity of topics that shift over time reflecting the breadth of interests engaging sociologists as Social Forces grew into one of the discipline’s premier journals. In addition to shifts in content, we examine changes in sociological work during this century. We find that articles have generally become more interdisciplinary, while being produced by larger, more gender inclusive and globalized teams. We examine both the most cited papers in Social Forces as well as factors associated with greater recognition. The overall story implied by these explorations suggests a vibrant journal that has shaped the way that sociology has worked over the last 100 years.},

This commitment reflected the aspirations of Howard Odum, a scholar with deep biographical, intellectual, and professional connections to the US South. The journal’s focus on the South was reinforced through Odum’s leadership and the editors that followed him for many decades. Many were his students, from the South, and/or studied the South themselves. Social Forces helped to build an intellectual and professional community of sociologists in the South that was reinforced through the journal’s affiliation with the Southern Sociological Society. As the journal, department, and profession changed, this focus on the US South waned. While Social Forces continues to publish cutting-edge research on the South, the relative attention to the South has declined to the same level as other top sociology journals. Thus, the South no longer serves as a distinguishing characteristic of Social Forces or its place in the discipline.},

Results indicated that for the protest issue of interest evaluations of the protest and protesters were more negative when photos depicting higher levels of conflict were shown. The amount of conflict shown in the photos did not affect evaluations of the protest and protesters when the issue was of less interest to participants. Additionally, participants who had more positive prior attitudes toward protesting in general were more likely to identify with the protesters in the stimulus story and to perceive that the protest was more effective than were those with more negative prior attitudes.

	abstract = {This study compares U.S. digital news coverage of recent foreign and domestic protests. Differences in coverage’s framing, sourcing, and device emphases were analyzed for two cases: protests that erupted after the death of Michael Brown and protests demanding justice for the 43 missing students from Ayotzinapa, Mexico. Building on protest paradigm literature, content analysis results show that news articles that appeared on Facebook and Twitter emphasized legitimizing frames for foreign protests more than domestic protests. Foreign protests were framed with the spectacle frame more than domestic protests, which were more often portrayed as confrontational. Digitally native news organizations produced content that deviated from expected paradigmatic norms the most. In addition, this research examines the relationship between content and sharing on Facebook and Twitter. Implications of these findings within the theoretical framework of the protest paradigm are discussed.},

Research routinely showed that mainstream media’s narrative choices marginalize and delegitimize protesters and their causes, a pattern known as the protest paradigm. This study provides a longitudinal examination of how the same mainstream media system varied in their coverage of similar events and the degree to which journalists challenged the predicted paradigms conceptualized in other academic work. A content analysis of national newspaper coverage revealed that news before the judicial rulings focused on protesters’ tactics (violence versus peaceful) and changed to the realm of ideas (grievances and demands) after the assailants were considered not guilty of wrongdoing. No progression was found in legitimizing coverage of protests between the two cases.},

	abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine coverage of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in seven US-based newspapers to determine whether the protest paradigm, “a pattern of news coverage that expresses disapproval toward protests and dissent,” and other marginalizing techniques are present, and racialized. Design/methodology/approach Relevant articles published during a six-month period of 2014 near the death of Michael Brown were retrieved from the selected outlets, including the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Textual and content analyses were performed. Findings The articles heavily followed the paradigm. An additional characteristic, blame attribution, was also identified. Language of crime, lawlessness, violence, blame for nearby acts of violence, and inflammatory quotes from bystanders and official sources were often present. There was little discussion of key issues associated with the formation of BLM. Research limitations/implications Mainstream outlets rather than social media or alternative outlets were examined. Future research should study coverage of BLM in other outlets. Practical implications Measures to avoid marginalizing protests and racialization of coverage, including increased diversity in the newsroom and monitoring for racialized language are suggested. Social implications Racialization of news and coverage of BLM has widespread negative consequences, such as association of Blacks with criminality that may affect their quality of life. The protest paradigm has the ability to squelch participation in social movements, which have the possibility to bring about needed social change. Originality/value This interdisciplinary paper highlights the important role of mainstream media and news routines in affecting the BLM movement. It uses diversity research to make recommendations for media practitioners to avoid racialization of news.},

After controlling for issue, newsworthiness, informational utility, valence, and other confounds, results show that—across platforms—a morality frame increases news sharing, whereas a conflict frame decreases it. Emphasizing economic consequences also decreases sharing, but only on Facebook. Surprisingly, the human interest angle has no noticeable effects. These results show that news frames can have behavioral consequences, and confirm the existence of a gap between preferred frames of journalists and users.},

How did the general public understand these protests, and where does support for the movement stand overall? We answer this question by drawing on several national surveys from 2020 and then examining the results of a framing experiment we conducted in June 2020. We structure the story we find in two parts—the partisans and the persuadables—both of whom are important to understanding public views of Black Lives Matter. Democrats and Republicans differ strongly in their views of the movement but are similar in the firmness of those views, which did not change in response to our framing experiment. Nonpartisans, in contrast, were more persuadable, though their reactions to some of our frames were conditioned by racial resentment. We conclude by setting the movement in historical context and assessing its impact, which we describe as complicated and contradictory but consequential.},

	abstract = {After the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a flood of protest activity against racial injustice ensued around the world, and a significant uptick in support for Black Lives Matter followed. This study investigated the narratives produced in news coverage of Black Lives Matter protests and how media consumption and individual predispositions help us understand public support for the movement. Combining a content analysis of news about protests and a survey of people’s attitudes, we assessed if patterns in mainstream and partisan coverage have changed, and how those patterns relate to people’s level of support for the movement, assessment of its effectiveness, and of police response during demonstrations. Our findings suggest that persistent negative patterns of protest coverage continued to dominate news headlines, with a major emphasis on negative actions, disruption, and violence in centerist- and right-leaning media coverage from the Associated Press, CNN and Fox News. MSNBC produced the least coverage overall, but their coverage was most legitimizing. Survey results showed that preexisting attitudes remain consistently stronger determinants of support for the movement than media coverage and suggested a possible ideological asymmetry among the general public. Conservative affiliation and news consumption are strong predictors of less support for Black Lives Matter and perceptions of police response to these protests as too lenient. Mainstream news consumption, though producing predominantly delegitimizing coverage, is correlated with more support for Black Lives Matter.},

	abstract = {The explosion of Black Lives Matter protests in the mid-2010s rendered visible state violence against Black Americans, producing a barrage of images and videos of lethal police violence and the protests that followed. These images served as a powerful site of contestation about the meaning of race and racism in the United States for both movement supporters and critics. We examine these dynamics through the lens of media coverage of the pivotal 2014 killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson and the protests that followed in Ferguson, MO. Drawing from literatures on race, visuality, and media studies, we explore how media outlets pictured the killing of Michael Brown and the protests in Ferguson, either resisting or reproducing the white racial frame through the selection of images in their coverage. We analyze the images in digital media coverage across nine ideologically diverse media outlets in the month after Brown?s death and the month following the non-indictment of Officer Wilson.

Based on a computer-assisted analysis of 3,579 news articles, the study shows that rather than operating as a rigid template, the protest paradigm offers national media a malleable set of journalistic devices that can be appropriated to construct the meaning of disruptive global events in a way that reproduces dominant domestic ideologies and advances the ruling elites? geopolitical interests. In addition to theoretical contribution, the study offers a novel empirical finding to the literature on protest coverage by providing evidence of national media not simply deviating from, but explicitly violating the protest paradigm. As demonstrated by the analysis of the Russian press, rather than delegitimizing the January 6 attackers by making light of their agenda and emphasizing their unruly behavior?which could be expected from coverage consistent with the protest paradigm?the Russian state-owned media trivialized the brutality of the attack by opting for cues with less violent connotations and elevated the legitimacy of the protesters? actions by framing them as valid demands by politically minded citizens unjustly prosecuted for concerns about the integrity of electoral process.},

Yet we know relatively little about the types of news sources Americans engage with most frequently on the platform. In this study, we evaluate the scope of news and information sources on Facebook, including engagement with these sources. We analyse nearly 12 million Facebook posts from 416 news organizations between 2012 and 2017. We find that the sources that receive the most user engagement are often the most ideologically extreme. We also find that alternative outlets that are politically conservative frequently get more engagement, which may provide them an outsized presence on users’ newsfeeds.},

	abstract = {Research Summary This study investigates the role of the news media in shaping attitudes toward the protests of 2020. Using data from a nationally representative election survey, it examines the association between news consumption and support for law-and-order policies to address protest violence, with perceptions that the protesters were violent as a potential mediator. Findings indicate that viewers of online news are less likely to support law-and-order policies. This relationship is mediated by perceived protester violence, with perceived violence enhancing support for law-and-order policies. Further examination shows that political bias plays a role: viewers of left-leaning sites are less likely to support law-and-order policies to address protest violence, while viewers of right-leaning sites are more likely. These relationships are also mediated by perceived violence. Policy Implications A slight majority of respondents indicate that they lean toward solving problems of racism and police violence, indicating that much of the American public is open to criminal justice reform. Perceived violence helps to shape the association of online news media with support for law-and-order policies. Activists should avoid violence in their protests and use Internet-based media sources to publicize their peaceful activities and demands. Law enforcement agencies should use the Internet and social media to keep the public informed of the reality of protests, especially of any violence that occurs, in an effort to justify forceful tactics.},

To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.},

The findings show that both platforms attach significance to the substantive attributes of policing, violence, and systemic racism. Notably, while the newspapers? overall agenda had a supportive tone, Twitter used a condemning tone. Moreover, the newspapers were more influential in terms of IAS, particularly in setting political and cultural attribute agendas. No IAS effects were found on the affective attributes. Furthermore, the IAS effects on the combined substantive and affective attributes have shrunk significantly. The newspapers were more influential in terms of the bundled substantive attribute agendas as well. This study advances agenda-setting research by examining multiple network agenda dimensions and introducing an affective attribute scale.

We examine these dynamics through the lens of media coverage of the pivotal 2014 killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson and the protests that followed in Ferguson, MO. Drawing from literatures on race, visuality, and media studies, we explore how media outlets pictured the killing of Michael Brown and the protests in Ferguson, either resisting or reproducing the white racial frame through the selection of images in their coverage. We analyze the images in digital media coverage across nine ideologically diverse media outlets in the month after Brown?s death and the month following the non-indictment of Officer Wilson.

Second, some but not all protestors made tactical adjustments by embracing social distancing or shifting to formats that did not require social distancing such as car caravans. Third, medical facilities much more commonly served as a location for demonstrations. Preliminary analysis also leads us to believe that protestors did not use online tools in dramatically new ways but probably did make use of these tools far more frequently.

The model’s out-of-sample forecasts predict protests with higher accuracy than extant work using structural predictors, high frequency event data, or other sources of big data such as Twitter.

	abstract = {Does activity on hard-right social media lead to hard-right civil unrest? If so, why? We created a spatial panel dataset comprising hard-right social media use and incidents of unrest across the United States from January 2020 through January 2021. Using spatial regression analyses with core-based statistical area (CBSA) and month fixed effects, we find that greater CBSA-level hard-right social media activity in a given month is associated with an increase in subsequent unrest. The results of robustness checks, placebo tests, alternative analytical approaches, and sensitivity analyses support this finding. To examine why hard-right social media activity predicts unrest, we draw on an original dataset of users? shared content and status in the online community. Analyses of these data suggest that hard-right social media shift users? perceptions of norms, increasing the likelihood they will participate in contentious events they once considered taboo. Our study sheds new light on social media?s offline effects, as well as the consequences of increasingly common hard-right platforms.},

We then review changing theoretical orientations and the major findings on ideologies and characteristics of these movements.

We pay particular attention to New Right and New Christian Right conservative movements and to right-wing skinhead and white supremacist movements.

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, catalogs of protest events have been at the heart of research on social movements. To measure how protest changes over time or varies across space, sociologists usually count the frequency of events, as either the dependent variable or a key independent variable. An alternative is to count the number of participants in protest. This article investigates demonstrations, strikes, and riots. Their size distributions manifest enormous variation. Most events are small, but a few large events contribute the majority of protesters. When events are aggregated by year or by city, the correlation between total participation and event frequency is low or modest. The choice of how to quantify protest is therefore vital; findings from one measure are unlikely to apply to another. The fact that the bulk of participation comes from large events has positive implications for the compilation of event catalogs. Rather than worrying about the underreporting of small events, concentrate on recording large ones accurately.},

	abstract = {Many NLP applications require manual data annotations for a variety of tasks, notably to train classifiers or evaluate the performance of unsupervised models. Depending on the size and degree of complexity, the tasks may be conducted by crowd-workers on platforms such as MTurk as well as trained annotators, such as research assistants. Using a sample of 2,382 tweets, we demonstrate that ChatGPT outperforms crowd-workers for several annotation tasks, including relevance, stance, topics, and frames detection. Specifically, the zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeds that of crowd-workers for four out of five tasks, while ChatGPT's intercoder agreement exceeds that of both crowd-workers and trained annotators for all tasks. Moreover, the per-annotation cost of ChatGPT is less than \$0.003 -- about twenty times cheaper than MTurk. These results show the potential of large language models to drastically increase the efficiency of text classification.},

In this setting, the capacity to distinguish trustworthy sources is critical for providing appropriate accuracy contexts to users. Here we assess whether ChatGPT, a prominent LLM, can evaluate the credibility of news outlets. With appropriate instructions, ChatGPT can provide ratings for a diverse set of news outlets, including those in non-English languages and satirical sources, along with contextual explanations. Our results show that these ratings correlate with those from human experts (Spearmam's \${\textbackslash}rho=0.54, p{\textless}0.001\$). These findings suggest that LLMs could be an affordable reference for credibility ratings in fact-checking applications. Future LLMs should enhance their alignment with human expert judgments of source credibility to improve information accuracy.},

In stunning detail, Lewis chronicles the little-known political agenda behind the Harlem Renaissance and Du Bois's relentless fight for equality and justice, including his steadfast refusal to allow whites to interpret the aspirations of black America. Seared by the rejection of terrified liberals and the black bourgeoisie during the Communist witch-hunts, Du Bois ended his days in uncompromising exile in newly independent Ghana.

We address this question by elaborating an institutional mediation model arguing that the news values, routines, and characteristics of the news media induce them to pay attention to movements depending on their characteristics and the political contexts in which they engage. The news-making characteristics of movements include their disruptive capacities and organizational strength, and the political contexts include a partisan regime in power, benefitting from national policies, and congressional investigations. To appraise these arguments, we analyze approximately 1 million news articles mentioning 29 social movements over the twentieth century, published in four national newspapers. We use negative binomial regression analyses and separate time-series analyses of the labor movement to assess the model’s robustness across different movements, time periods, and news sources. In each analysis, the results support the hypotheses based on the institutional mediation model. More generally, we argue that the influence of social movements on institutions depends on the structure and operating procedures of those institutions. This insight has implications for future studies of the influence of movements on major social institutions.},

	abstract = {What drives the news coverage of social movements in the professional news media? We address this question by elaborating an institutional mediation model arguing that the news values, routines, and characteristics of the news media induce them to pay attention to movements depending on their characteristics and the political contexts in which they engage. The news-making characteristics of movements include their disruptive capacities and organizational strength, and the political contexts include a partisan regime in power, benefitting from national policies, and congressional investigations. To appraise these arguments, we analyze approximately 1 million news articles mentioning 29 social movements over the twentieth century, published in four national newspapers. We use negative binomial regression analyses and separate time-series analyses of the labor movement to assess the model’s robustness across different movements, time periods, and news sources. In each analysis, the results support the hypotheses based on the institutional mediation model. More generally, we argue that the influence of social movements on institutions depends on the structure and operating procedures of those institutions. This insight has implications for future studies of the influence of movements on major social institutions.},

	abstract = {Over the last hundred years, there have been approximately four eras of studies of collective political mobilizations in the pages of Social Forces. While each of the four periods contains a diversity of topics, each also has a central tendency influenced by the sociology of the era, the journal’s focus, and current events. In this essay, I describe the different eras and identify some notable areas of continuity across the century.In its first decade, Social Forces articles primarily discussed collective action in reports on current political organizations or analysis of ongoing racist violence, particularly lynching and the Klan. From the 1930s to WWII, the focus of articles expanded to a wider variety of movements and activities and were more likely to incorporate sociological theory. The social movements of the 1950s and 1960s were closely examined in the next phase, and articles continue to evolve to include both theory and analysis in the same pieces. Finally, the contemporary era saw a vast increase in the movements studied, methods employed, and a more granular examination of movement processes. Throughout all the periods, two major themes, examining anti-Black collective violence and the role of organizations in politics, were consistently fruitful research areas.},

Relational data structures can capture the theoretically important structuring of events into campaigns and episodes and media attention cascades and cycles. Relational data structures support richer theorizing about the interplay of protests and their representations in news media discourses.

We develop an institutional mediation model that argues that combinations of the news-heightening characteristics of movements, including their disruptive capacities, organizational resources, and political orientation, and political contexts, including partisan regimes and benefiting from national policies, bring extensive attention to movements. It also holds that investigations will draw extensive media attention to movements, and those that have achieved prominence in the news will remain prominent under specific conditions. We appraise these combinational arguments by examining 29 social movements across 100 years in four national newspapers using qualitative comparative analysis (QCA). Researchers typically use QCA to study the consequences of movements when they hypothesize outcomes to result from multiple combinations of conditions. This raises our second main question: How should scholars best address combinational hypotheses using QCA? Here we employ Venn diagrams to identify and illustrate key analytical issues and anomalies, including constrained diversity in observational data, empirical instances when combinations of conditions do not produce the expected outcome, and instances when unexpected combinations of conditions produce a consistent result. We also demonstrate the value of broad comparisons across movements and over time in these analyses.},

Harm reduction and self-managed abortion appear in the professional literature largely as evidenced-based public health strategies, more than as social movements. However, each began at the margins of the law as a form of direct action developed by activists anchored in social justice movements and working in community contexts independent of both state and institutional control according to a human rights perspective of bodily integrity and autonomy. An analysis of the history and dynamics of harm reduction and self-managed abortion as social movements underlies the proposed framework of autonomous health movements, and additional potential examples of such movements are identified. The framework of autonomous health movements opens up new pathways for thinking about the development of autonomous, community-based health strategies under conditions of marginalization and criminalization.},

                Efforts to establish harm reduction interventions in Italy have persisted since the mid-1990s. Despite this, no sanctioned SIF has ever been implemented. The purpose of this paper is to provide information about a 10 year unsanctioned drug user-run SIF experience in Italy called
                Stanzetta
                .
              
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                The aim of the paper is to assess how
                Stanzetta
                met its objectives. Analysis was conducted compiling narrative accounts from the staff working in the NSP, which is adjacent to the
                Stanzetta
                , and conducting a simple frequency analysis of the available statistical data.
              
            
            
              Findings
              
                The
                Stanzetta
                unsanctioned SIF has been running for ten years and continues to be vulnerable due to its legal status. Being open 24 h/days has maximised its accessibility, but at the same time, it has encouraged a misuse of the
                Stanzetta
                . Although not trained, drug users became self-empowered to run the
                Stanzetta
                and to keep it clean, but the hygiene-health aspect is seen as one of the greatest challenges by the NSP professional staff. Over 10 years, not a single overdose death has been recorded. Drug use in the park has shifted from more visible places to the
                Stanzetta
                . As a result, the abandoned syringes have diminished in number and those disposed of correctly have increased. Moreover, no complaints from citizens or law enforcement were ever made. The neighbourhood acceptance seems to be the main goal of the peer-run unsanctioned SIF.
              
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The paper is based on a narrative account from the point of view of the professional staff involved, and results are specific to the context in which the study was conducted. Because of the chosen approach, the research results lack scientific generalisability. A relevant limitation is that no peer was involved in this study. Despite this, the research contributes to the information based on peer-run SIFs and makes a case for the de-medicalisation of SIFs in Europe.
            
            
              Practical implications
              This paper gives visibility to a long-lasting drug user-run SIF experience that was not made public mostly for an unclear legislative background about SIF in Italy.
            
            
              Social implications
              Efforts to establish harm reduction interventions in Italy have persisted since the mid-1990s and were undertaken primarily in response to epidemics of HIV infection and overdose (DPA, 2017). Despite this, no sanctioned SIF has ever been implemented. Primarily, this study wants to underline the urgency for an SIF pilot in Italy, and secondly the need to consider de-medicalising these services through direct support for peer-based models.
            
            
              Originality/value
              
                The
                Stanzetta
                unsanctioned SIF in Italy that has been running for ten years. Despite this, the venue continues to be vulnerable due to its legal status. For this reason, these results were never made public before. The experience showed a good working synergy between NSP professionals and the SIF peers. This model can be considered as a “light” de-medicalisation form to be explored and eventually to be implemented as a pilot SIF in Italy.},

Policies and programs using it have dramatically improved the formerly ignored health problems of marginalized populations. This article looks at the history of harm reduction, and the growing role that the medicalization of social and political problems plays in the governance of the margins in the neo-liberal state. It describes how the acceptance of harm reduction approaches coincided with a political need to address social disorder and reduce expense in health and legal services, and criticizes the current assumption that more harm reduction services will automatically result in a more humane society. While this paper supports those authors who urge a greater political engagement from harm reduction advocates in public health, it also urges a direct political critique of the social and legal systems that create harm, and the harm reduction research that critically examines how harm reduction, while aiming to prevent harm in the short term, may sustain systems of harm in a larger sense.},

DCRs are health facilities, operating under a harm reduction philosophy, where people consume illicit drugs in a supervised setting. Approximately 90 are located in almost 60 cities in 11 countries. They are intensely local attempts to improve the lives of speciﬁc populations and urban neighborhoods. DCRs are also global models that travel. This article examines the relationship between DCRs as facilities that are ﬁxed in place and DCRs as globally-mobilized models of drug policy and public health practice. Drawing on research from seven countries, we apply concepts from the policy mobilities literature to analyze the travels of the DCR model and the political strategies involved in the siting of these public health service facilities. We detail the networked mobilization of the DCR model from Europe to Canada and Australia, the learning among facilities, the strategies used to mold the DCR model to local contexts, and the role of DCR staff in promoting continued proliferation of DCRs. We conclude by identifying some immobilities of DCRs to identify questions about practices, principles and future directions of harm reduction.},

	abstract = {The paper analyses methadone treatment in Copenhagen – as it is described by methadone users and staff at different outpatient centres. The starting point is a theoretical model distinguishing between two different approaches to methadone treatment: ‘palliative’ and ‘curative’. Included in the model are three dimensions (1) treatment goals at the methadone centres (abstinence vs. stabilisation) (2) treatment focus (focus on addiction vs. focus on the consequences of addiction) and (3) conceptualisation of methadone (methadone as similar to or different from heroin). The paper shows that there is a discrepancy between the attitudes of the staff and those of the users. While the staff favour an almost clear-cut palliative approach to methadone treatment, deﬁning curative goals as both unrealistic and as belonging to the past, the users prefer an approach that does not exclude the goal of abstinence and does not focus on the consequences of drug use alone but also on their problematic relationship to drugs (legal as well as illegal). Furthermore, the users’ attitudes towards methadone are far more ambivalent than the staff’s. For the users, methadone is not just medicine; it is also a dependence-producing and ‘dangerous’ drug.},

	abstract = {After decades on the social and political margins, far-right groups and movements are enjoying increasing success, and even claiming a place in mainstream electoral politics in many Western political systems.Research shows that new media like Twitter, YouTube, and community sites likes 4chan and Reddit are increasingly involved with the mobilization of popular support for far-right electoral campaigns, and even organized political violence. These technologies – including other social media, discussion websites, certain online games, chat servers, talk radio, cable news, and print media – are making contemporary far-right ideologies possible in diverse ways, altering methods of recruitment to the extent that they become unrecognizable from far-right movements of the past, and thus, more dangerous. The results of these new technological processes can be seen in the increasing normalization of far-right values within mainstream culture, politics, and media ecosystems within countries from the United States, Britain, Australia, Germany, and Hungary. This book brings together recent academic research exploring how far-right groups use new media to recruit followers to extremist beliefs and mobilize political action. In doing so, the book reveals the complex ways that evolving technologies are used both purposively, subtly, and in some cases incidentally, to recruit and mobilize far-right support.},

Illustrated with data from surveys of pro-environmental behavior, a climate march, a global climate strike, and an Extinction Rebellion action, this chapter provides further evidence on how and why the role of networks varies across mobilization contexts.},

They help recruit members, sustain organizations, nourish participants' movement identities, and disseminate information. Scholarship has pointed to the formative role of social media and other information and communication technologies in online and offline mobilization. Questions remain, however, regarding how online social and friendship networks shape social movements. In this article, I draw from literature on social networks, online mobilization, and women's movements to examine the role of online feminist social networks in feminist mobilization. Presenting qualitative data from a racially and geographically heterogeneous group of college feminists, I argue that Facebook and feminist blogs enlarge and nourish feminist networks, create online feminist communities, expand recruitment bases for online and offline mobilization, and increase opportunities for online interaction with adversaries. Finally, I consider generational shifts in the feminist movement, and the broader relationship between friendship networks and online and offline mobilization.},

It has been criticized by some as too confrontational and divisive. The purpose of this study is to undertake a comparative analysis of the BLM Movement and the civil rights movement (1954-1965). As social movements, both have evolved out of the need to continue the Black liberation struggle for freedom. I have conducted a content analysis of the New York Times newspaper during a 2-year period for both social movements to examine the issue framing of each. I argue that the civil rights movement framed its issues in a more inclusive manner than BLM. BLM should take a lesson from the civil rights movement by boldly taking on an issue like police brutality of African Americans and expanding the boundaries of something that is politically unacceptable to being acceptable.},

Varied scholarly approaches to social advocacy over the past four decades have tended to highlight skilled actors who craft rhetorical appeals and pursue resources and opportunities strategically to win their ends. Lichterman argues that this approach presents a thin view of culture and oversimplifies action as a product of collective actors whose speech and action do not vary by setting. In this study of housing advocacy, he turns the analytic lens away from the actors to the social settings and the cultural contexts of unfolding action, which allows him to develop a more precise explanation of success and failure. Lichterman draws on four years of ethnographic research on four campaigns, three coalitions, and twelve organizations that took up affordable housing, homelessness, and related problems in Los Angeles. The author follows how the actors' identities, claims and strategies unfold in specific settings as they promote new legislation, oppose gentrification, build affordable housing, and pursue health and environmental issues alongside housing problems. He finds that the discursive fields are crucial contexts that influence the work and that organization style powerfully shapes civic action.

            What determines the quality of coverage received by social movement organizations when they appear extensively in the news? Research on the news coverage of social movement organizations is dominated by case studies supporting the “protest paradigm,” which argues that journalists portray movement activists trivially and negatively when covering protest. However, movement organizations often make long‐running news for many different reasons, mainly not protest. We argue that some of this extensive news will lead to worse coverage—in terms of substance and sentiment—notably when the main action covered involves violence. Extensive coverage centered on other actions, however, notably politically assertive action, will tend to produce “good news” in these dimensions. We analyze the news of the twentieth century's 100 most‐covered U.S. movement organizations in their biggest news year in four national newspapers. Topic models indicate that these organizations were mainly covered for actions other than nonviolent protest, including politically assertive action, strikes, civic action, investigations, trials, and violence. Natural language processing analyses and hand‐coding show that their news also varied widely in sentiment and substance. Employing qualitative comparative analyses, we find that the main action behind news strongly influences its quality, and there may be several news paradigms for movement organizations.},
