I am a Full Professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://sociology.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu). 

My  research focuses on contemporary US social movements and the uses of media data for understanding movement processes. With Edwin Amenta, I authored *[Rough Draft of History: A Century of US Social Movements in the News](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691232775/rough-draft-of-history)* (Princeton 2022), and my work has appeared in journals including *American Sociological Review*, *Social Forces*, *Social Problems*, and the *Annual Review of Sociology*. I'm also currently editing [a collection](https://www.dareyoufight.org) of W.E.B. Du Bois's writings published in *The Crisis*. 

I serve as editor of [*Mobilization*](https://mobilizationjournal.org), the premier interdisciplinary journal specializing in social movements, protests, insurgencies, revolutions, and other forms of contentious politicsâ€”check out our [most recent issue](https://mobilizationjournal.org/toc/maiq/24/1). 

At Carolina, I serve as Director of the First Year Seminars and Launch program while teaching introduction to sociology (SOCI 101) and Social and Economic Justice (SOCI 274) At the graduate level, I teach computational social science, focusing on collecting and analyzing text data with Python. 

Outside academia, I enjoy the trails in [Carolina North Forest](https://facilities.unc.edu/operations/grounds-services/carolina-north-forest/) and am a mediocre [trail racer](https://ultrasignup.com/results_participant.aspx?fname=Neal&lname=Caren).
